                  <i>Z</i>)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-2-pentenoate (inactive), along with a lactone breakdown
                  product. The activity of the synthetic 
                  <i>E-</i>isomer was confirmed by GC-EAD, GC-MS, NMR, and bioassays. No antennal response was
                  observed to the 
                  <i>Z-</i>isomer or the lactone. In a two-choice olfactometer bioassay, female 
                  <i>D. abbreviatus</i> moved upwind towards the synthetic pheromone or natural pheromone more often compared
                  with clean air. Males showed no clear preference for the synthetic pheromone. This
                  pheromone, alone or in combination with plant volatiles, may play a role in the location
                  of males by female 
                  <i>D. abbreviatus</i>.

            <p>The root weevil, 
               <i>Diaprepes abbreviatus</i> (L.) (Curculionidae: Entiminae) (Marvaldi et al., 
               <a href="#CR20">2002</a>), is a major pest of citrus in the Caribbean and Florida. Prior to the 1960's, 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> was reported only in the Caribbean; the multiple phenotypic populations that occur
               in Puerto Rico suggest this as its center of origin (Lapointe, 
               <a href="#CR16">2004</a>). Since discovery of 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> near Apopka, Florida in 1964, this weevil has spread to Louisiana, Texas, and California
               leaving no geographic or climatic barrier to its movement south to Mexico, Mesoamerica,
               and South America (Lapointe et al., 
               <a href="#CR17">2007</a>). 
               <i>Diaprepes abbreviatus</i> is typical of Entiminae in that the adults do not use the rostrum to create a niche
               for egg laying, and larvae feed externally on roots (Marvaldi et al., 
               <a href="#CR20">2002</a>). Adults feed and oviposit on foliage of a wide range of host plants (Simpson et
               al., 
               <a href="#CR27">1996</a>). Neonate larvae fall to the ground and burrow into the soil where they feed on progressively
               larger roots as they grow. Larvae pupate in the soil and emerge as adults throughout
               the year.
            </p>
            <p>Within the superfamily Curculionoidea, the majority of known pheromones are long-range,
               male-produced aggregation pheromones (Seybold and Vanderwel, 
               <a href="#CR26">2003</a>; Ambrogi et al., 
               <a href="#CR1">2009</a>). Aggregations of 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> adults have been observed on so-called "party trees" (Wolcott, 
               <a href="#CR29">1936</a>). Schroeder (
               <a href="#CR24">1981</a>) suggested that a 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> male-produced pheromone attracted females, and a female-produced pheromone attracted
               males. Jones and Schroeder (
               <a href="#CR15">1984</a>) demonstrated that a male-produced pheromone in the feces attracted both sexes of
               
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i>, and there may be a pheromone responsible for arrestment behavior (Lapointe and Hall,
               
               <a href="#CR19">2009</a>). Otálora-Luna et al. (
               <a href="#CR21">2009</a>) identified plant volatiles from citrus leaves that elicited antennal responses in
               
               <i>D. abbreviatus.</i> Such kairomones may act in concert with a pheromone to attract conspecifics to a
               suitable food source (Dickens et al., 
               <a href="#CR11">1990</a>).
            </p>
            <p>We report here the isolation from headspace and feces of males, identification, and
               synthesis of a pheromone that attracts 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> females.

               <p>Adult weevils were obtained from a laboratory colony maintained at the U. S. Horticultural
                  Research Laboratory, Ft. Pierce, FL, USA, supplemented annually with field-collected
                  adults. Neonate larvae were placed on artificial diet (product no. F1675, Bio-Serv,
                  Inc., Frenchtown, NJ, USA) and reared as described by Lapointe et al. (
                  <a href="#CR18">2008</a>). Adult males and females were held in separate 60 x 60 x 60 cm mesh cages with water-saturated
                  dental wicks, and fed young citrus leaves (
                  <i>Citrus macrophylla</i> Wester) until use in aerations or bioassays. Groups of 10–20 adults 4–6 wk-old were
                  held without food for 24 h prior to behavioral assays. After the assay, adults were
                  returned to their respective cages and provided food and water. Individual unmated
                  adults were used in tests no more than once per week over a period of ~3 mo. Cohorts
                  of known age were caged separately.

               <p>The GC-EAD system consisted of an Agilent 7890A GC equipped with a split/splitless
                  injector, an HP-1 capillary column (30 m x 0.32 mm x 0.25 μm, Agilent Technologies,
                  Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA), a post column glass Y-tube (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA,
                  USA) splitter dividing the effluent in a 1:1 ratio between the flame ionization detector
                  (FID) and heated EAD transfer line (200°C). Lengths of deactivated column (0.32 mm
                  ID) were used to carry the effluent to the FID and EAD port after the split. The heated
                  transfer line emptied into to a charcoal-filtered, humidified air stream (200 ml/min
                  at 30 cm/sec) that carried the effluent over an antennal preparation. The air stream
                  was directed past a probe attached to a type PRG-2 amplifier (Universal EAG probe,
                  Syntech, Hilversum, The Netherlands). Signals from the amplifier and the FID were
                  conditioned using a Syntech IDAC-2 interface. EAG and FID signals acquired from the
                  IDAC-2 were displayed and stored on a computer running the GC-EAD 2011 software program
                  (Syntech). An adult weevil antenna was mounted between the leads of the Universal
                  EAG probe. The antennal preparation was made by plucking the antenna from the insect
                  (grasping it firmly at the base of the antenna near the head with fine forceps) and
                  placing it between two metal electrodes on the probe, to which small amounts of salt-free
                  electrode gel (Spectra 360, Parker Laboratories, Fairfield, NJ, USA) had been applied.
                  At the start of GC-EAD runs, the GC oven temperature was held at 35°C for 3 min, increased
                  to 260°C at 15°C/min with a 10 min final hold. Injector and FID temperatures were
                  220°C and 300°C, respectively. Splitless injection was used with helium as the carrier
                  gas at a flow rate of 2.3 ml/min.

               <p>Coupled GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was conducted using instruments operated in the
                  electron impact (EI) and chemical ionization (CI) modes. EI spectra were obtained
                  using an Agilent 5973 MS interfaced to a 6890 GC equipped with a cool on-column injector.
                  The injector was fitted with a 10 cm length of 0.5 mm id deactivated fused silica
                  tubing connected to 1 m (0. 25 mm id) length of deactivated fused silica tubing as
                  a retention gap. The retention gap was connected to a 30 m x 0.25 mm id with 0.25 μm
                  coating thickness DB5MS® analytical column. The injector and oven temperature were
                  programmed from 30°C for 5 min to 225°C at 10°C/min. Spectra were obtained between
                  60–300 amu. Chemical ionization spectra were obtained using an Agilent 5975 MS interfaced
                  to a 7890 GC. The GC was equipped with a cool on-column injector fitted with retention
                  gaps as above. The analytical column used was a 30 m x 0.25 mm id, 0.25 μm coating
                  thickness DB1MS®. The GC was operated using the same program as for EI spectra, and
                  the CI spectra were obtained by scanning from m/z 60–300 using isobutane as reagent
                  gas.

                  <i>D. abbreviatus</i>, held separately, were placed in separate glass aeration chambers without plant material,
                  and provided with a continuous flow (500 ml/min) of filtered, humidified air for 24 h
                  at 27°C in an environmental chamber (12:12 h L:D). Volatiles were collected on Super
                  Q filters (Alltech Deerfield, IL, USA) connected to the exit port of the aeration
                  chambers. After collection, the filters were eluted with 500 μl of CH
                  <sub>2</sub>Cl
                  <sub>2</sub>. The accumulated feces in the aeration chambers at the end of the 24-h collection
                  period were collected by washing the chambers with a minimum amount of CH
                  <sub>2</sub>Cl
                  <sub>2</sub>; the resulting extract was filtered and concentrated under nitrogen.

               <p>As an initial purification, CH
                  <sub>2</sub>Cl
                  <sub>2</sub> eluates (200 μl) from the Super Q filters and washes of the aeration chambers were
                  passed through Supelclean LC-SI solid phase extraction (SPE) columns containing 200 mg
                  of packing (Supelco, Bellefont, PA) previously conditioned with 15 ml of CH
                  <sub>2</sub>Cl
                  <sub>2</sub>. The CH
                  <sub>2</sub>Cl
                  <sub>2</sub> eluates plus a filter wash of 2 ml of CH
                  <sub>2</sub>Cl
                  <sub>2</sub> were saved to check for the presence of the EAD-active compound. The SPE column was
                  eluted with 2 ml each of pentane containing 15% ethyl acetate (EtOAc), 30% ETOAc,
                  and 50% ETOAc. The three SPE column fractions, and the saved CH
                  <sub>2</sub>Cl
                  <sub>2</sub> eluates, were analyzed by EI GC-MS for the presence of the EAD-active compound suspected
                  to have a molecular weight of 172. Only the 15% EtOAc fraction contained the compound
                  of interest. This fraction was concentrated to ca. 100 μl under a fine stream of N
                  <sub>2</sub> and subjected to fractionation by preparative GC. Initial fractionation was accomplished
                  using an Agilent 6890 GC® with cool-on-column injector fitted with a 20 cm length
                  of deactivated fused silica attached to a 30 m x 0.53 mm id (0.5 μm film thickness)
                  DB1 column. The preparative column was split using a “Y” capillary connector between
                  equal lengths of 0.1 mm id and 0.25 mm id lengths of deactivated fused silica column.
                  The effluent from the 0.1 mm id column (ca. 13.8%) went to the FID, while the 0.25 mm
                  id column (ca 86.2%) exited the wall of the GC and into the heated block (200°C) of
                  a Brownlee-Silverstein collector (Brownlee and Silverstein, 
                  <a href="#CR7">1968</a>). Ten μl samples were injected onto the column at an initial temperature of 30°C,
                  and after 2 min the oven temperature was increased to a final temperature of 225°C
                  at 10°C/min. The fractions were collected in a 30-cm liquid nitrogen-cooled glass
                  capillary (Brownlee and Silverstein, 
                  <a href="#CR7">1968</a>), and were recovered by washing the capillaries with 3 25-μl aliquots of CH
                  <sub>2</sub>Cl
                  <sub>2</sub>. Fractions were analyzed by GC-MS for the presence of compounds having 
                  <i>m/z</i> 154, 142, and 140 ions, all of which eluted within 0.01 min of each other. These
                  fractions were combined, concentrated, and re-fractionated using a DB35 column (30 m
                  x 0.53 mm id, 0.5 μm film thickness) as above. The fractions from this separation
                  were eluted from capillaries using deuterated chloroform (99.96% CDCl
                  <sub>3</sub>, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.), analyzed by GC-MS, and the fractions containing
                  the compound having the 172 MW were combined, concentrated under N

                  consistent antennal response, and was co-injected with methyl (
                  <i>E</i>)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-2-pentenoate to confirm that antennae were viable. Antennae
                  from male and female 
                  <i>D. abbreviatus</i> were tested.
               </p>
               <p>Behavioral response to the pheromone was tested in an olfactometer (Model 4 C, ARS,
                  Inc., Micanopy, FL USA). Individual weevils (starved for 24 h) were placed in a glass
                  inlet, allowed to walk upwards into the center of an arena with a balanced, filtered,
                  and humidified airflow from two arms oriented at 180° to each other and outfitted
                  with glass reservoirs containing an odor source or blank. The assays were conducted
                  in the dark between 9 am and 2 pm because of a strong phototropic response in this
                  insect (Lapointe and Hall, 
                  <a href="#CR19">2009</a>). Each run was terminated when the weevil moved into one of the glass receptacles
                  or after 15 min. Weevil position was scored as no-response (remaining in the inlet),
                  no-choice (moving to, but remaining in the central arena), or choosing one of the
                  two arms. Responses of unmated 4-6-wk-old males and females were recorded to various
                  odor sources: fresh young citrus leaves (flush), flush fed upon for 24 h by male 
                  <i>D. abbreviatus</i>, 30 μg of methyl (
                  <i>E</i>)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-2-pentenoate in 10:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate pipetted
                  onto a glass slide, and a clean glass slide. All glass components of the olfactometer
                  were washed thoroughly between runs with warm soap and water, rinsed with methanol,
                  and air-dried. Between replications of a given treatment, the arms of the olfactometer
                  used for that treatment were switched to control for bias in the apparatus. The number
                  of weevils choosing a treatment arm was compared with the control arm (clean air)
                  by the 
                  <i>G</i>-test (Sokal and Rohlf, 
                  <a href="#CR28">1994</a>).

            <p>One compound from aerations of male weevils consistently elicited antennal responses
               from both male and female 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> in GC-EAD experiments (Fig. 
               <a href="#Fig2">2</a>). The amount of this compound in 24-h aerations of ten 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> males was sufficient to elicit responses from the antennae of males and females,
               but the compound was barely detectable by GC. The same compound also was recovered
               in CH
               <sub>2</sub>Cl
               <sub>2</sub> by washing the frass of males from glass aeration jars. Combining multiple aerations
               of males provided sufficient material to obtain CI and EI mass spectra (Fig. 
               <a href="#Fig3">3a</a>, b). Initial GC analyses indicated the presence of several compounds eluting in the
               area of the EAD-active compound (Fig. 
               <a href="#Fig2">2</a>). EI GC-MS analyses indicated that several of these, including the EAD-active compound,
               had an 
               <i>m/z</i> 154 ion and fragmentation patterns corresponding to monoterpene alcohols. Although
               the EI mass spectrum of the EAD-active compound showed an 
               <i>m/z</i> 154 ion (Fig. 
               <a href="#Fig3">3b</a>), the presence of an 
               <i>m/z</i> 142 ion indicated that 
               <i>m/z</i> 154 might not be the molecular ion; the latter possibility was verified by SIM analysis
               showing 
               <i>m/z</i> 140, 142, and 154 ions maximized within ±0.01 min of each other. CI-MS analysis (Fig. 
               <a href="#Fig3">3a</a>) exhibited a clear M + 1 ion at 
               <i>m/z</i> 173, thus supporting a molecular weight of 172 Daltons for the EAD-active compound.
               In addition, the CI analysis also exhibited a base peak at 
               <i>m/z</i> 141 (M + 1-CH
               <sub>3</sub>OH), and a prominent 
               <i>m/z</i> 155 ion (M + 1-18); thus, the 
               <i>m/z</i> 154 ion in the EI spectrum is due to loss of H
               <sub>2</sub>O. The CI did not directly indicate the origin of the 
               <i>m/z</i> 142 fragment in the EI spectra; however, the loss of 30 amu (
               <i>m/z</i> 172–142) suggested a long range proton transfer to a carbonyl group followed by a
               neutral loss of CH
               <sub>2</sub> = O, which is consistent with a hydrocarbon chain having a terminal alcohol as well
               as a carbonyl. This interpretation also was congruent with a methyl ester as suggested
               by the (M + 1-CH
               <sub>3</sub>OH) loss in the CI spectrum. A characteristic neutral loss of 32 amu also was seen
               in the EI spectra (
               <i>m/z</i> 142
               <i>–</i>110), thereby supporting the structure of a methyl ester. Furthermore, the neutral
               loss of 15 amu (
               <i>m/z</i> 142–127 as well as 
               <i>m/z</i> 110–95) suggested the presence of a methyl branch. Thus, the fragmentation patterns
               indicated a formula of C
               <sub>9</sub>H
               <sub>16</sub>O
               <sub>3</sub> with 2 degrees of unsaturation, the presence of a methyl ester, and at least one
               methyl branch, and a terminal C-OH. Further aerations of groups of up to 30 males,
               and fractionations by preparative GC using both polar and nonpolar capillary columns,
               resulted in collection of a sufficient amount of the pheromone for NMR analysis (Table 
               <a href="#Tab1">1</a>). These experiments enabled the structure assignment for the EAD-active peak as methyl
               (
               <i>E</i>)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-2-pentenoate (
               <b>1</b>
               <i>E)</i>. The NMR analysis also revealed an antennally inactive isomer (methyl (
               <i>Z</i>)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-2-pentenoate), and a related lactone 
               <b>2</b> (Table 
               <a href="#Tab2">2</a>) that apparently originated from partial isomerization and lactonization of the putative
               pheromone catalyzed by CDCl
               <sub>3</sub>.

            <p>The structure of the synthetic compound was confirmed as identical with the natural
               EAD-active compound by mass spectral (Fig. 
               <a href="#Fig3">3c</a>) and NMR analyses. As with the natural material, the synthetic material contained
               a pair of Z/E-isomers of methyl 3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-2-pentenoate, along with
               the lactone breakdown product. The NMR of the synthetic sample obtained in C
               <sub>6</sub>D
               <sub>6</sub> showed two doublets at 0.79 and 0.91 ppm (corresponding to the doublets at 1.09 and
               1.12 ppm in the isolated material) due to a pair of methyl groups from both stereoisomers
               split by a single proton on the adjacent carbon. Similarly, there was a pair of singlets
               at 3.34 and 3.41 ppm due to methyl groups from isomeric esters corresponding to the
               singlets at 3.73 and 3.71 ppm in the NMR of natural sample recorded in CDCl
               <sub>3</sub>. A NOE difference spectrum obtained by irradiating the resonance of the larger doublet
               at 0.79 ppm resulted in enhancement of the larger singlet from the olefinic proton
               at 5.80 ppm and vice versa. Therefore, the olefinic proton and the isopropyl group
               in the major stereoisomer are in 
               <i>cis</i>-position, and this stereoisomer and the natural product have the 
               <i>E</i>-configuration.

               <p>The antennae of both males and females responded to methyl (
                  <i>E</i>)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-2-pentenoate, and neither responded to the 
                  <i>Z</i>-isomer or to the lactone (Fig. 
                  <a href="#Fig4">4</a>). In two-choice olfactometer tests, female weevils consistently moved upwind more
                  often (α = 0.05, 
                  <i>G</i>-test) to the olfactometer arm containing either 30 μg of methyl (
                  <i>E</i>)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-2-pentenoate (
                  <b>1</b>
                  <i>E</i>) or citrus leaves previously fed upon by males (MFUF) than to the arm with clean
                  air (Table 
                  <a href="#Tab3">3</a>). Males did not show a clear preference for the 
                  <b>1</b>
                  <i>E</i> or MFUF compared with clean air. Neither males nor females showed a preference when
                  offered a choice between clean air and citrus leaves (flush). Results not reported
                  here suggest that males may be attracted or repelled by the odor of other males due
                  to factors we do not yet understand.

            <p>An attractant has been sought for 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> for over 30 years. Our GC-EAD and GC-MS analyses of headspace volatiles and frass
               collected from male 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> provided the initial evidence of a putative pheromone consisting of a single, novel
               compound. GC-MS and NMR analyses enabled us to determine the structure of the EAD-active
               compound as methyl (
               <i>E</i>)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-2-pentenoate (
               <b>
                  <i>1</i>
               </b>
               <i>E</i>). We then synthesized the putative pheromone compound, and showed that the synthetic
               compound elicited positive antennal and olfactometer responses verifying that this
               compound is an attractant pheromone for female 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i>. Whereas the pheromone 
               <b>1</b>
               <i>E</i> is novel, its lactone degradation product 
               <b>2</b> was described as a constituent of tobacco flavor (Pettersson et al., 
               <a href="#CR22">1993</a>), and synthesized (D’Annibale et al., 
               <a href="#CR10">2007</a>; Brichacek and Carlson, 
               <a href="#CR5">2007</a>). As with other curculionids (Ambrogi et al., 
               <a href="#CR1">2009</a>), the 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> attractant pheromone is male-produced; however, in the bioassays conducted to date,
               we have demonstrated a significant attraction of conspecific females but not males.
               This represents the first progress towards development of semiochemical-based methods
               for managing 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i>, a serious pest of many crops and ornamental plants that is expanding its geographic
               range in the Neotropics and subtropics.
            </p>
            <p>Schroeder (
               <a href="#CR24">1981</a>) conducted field tests suggesting that 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> weevils were attracted to trees that had been infested overnight by conspecifics
               of the opposite sex, thereby implying the existence of two sex-specific aggregation
               pheromones. Subsequently, Beavers et al. (
               <a href="#CR2">1982</a>) conducted olfactometer bioassays showing 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> attraction to the frass of the opposite sex, along with same-sex attraction. Both
               Jones and Schroeder (
               <a href="#CR15">1984</a>), and Schroeder and Beavers (
               <a href="#CR25">1985</a>) then conducted field trapping experiments demonstrating that extracts of male 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> attracted both 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> males and females; attraction to frass from males was also demonstrated by Harari
               and Landolt (
               <a href="#CR14">1997</a>). Lapointe and Hall (
               <a href="#CR19">2009</a>) found that males responded by arresting their movement on citrus leaves previously
               fed and defecated upon by males or females, thereby suggesting the presence of a female-produced
               pheromone. From these reports and our own data, we believe there are volatile compounds
               of insect origin, in addition to methyl (
               <i>E</i>)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-2-pentenoate, that influence the behavior of 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i>. Our data do not preclude the existence of a female-produced pheromone. The consistent
               suggestion that female frass also contains an attractant merits further study. Discovery
               of the male-produced pheromone in 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> appears to be only the first step towards elucidating the chemical ecology of this
               highly polyphagous and damaging weevil.
            </p>
            <p>Among the Entiminae (i.e., the broad-nosed weevils), the only one other pheromone
               known is the aggregation pheromone of 
               <i>Sitona lineatus</i> (4-methyl-3,5-heptanedione) (Blight et al., 
               <a href="#CR3">1984</a>). Blight and Wadhams (
               <a href="#CR4">1987</a>) suggested that 
               <i>S. lineatus</i> produces its aggregation pheromone in the spring, and that pheromonal activity is
               synergized by host plant volatiles, including (
               <i>Z</i>)-3-hexen-1-ol and linalool. These compounds, and others isolated from headspace over
               citrus leaves, consistently elicit antennal responses from 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> (Otálora-Luna et al., 
               <a href="#CR21">2009</a>). It remains to be seen if these plant volatiles synergize or otherwise augment activity
               of the 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> pheromone, and we do not understand the potential influence of rearing conditions,
               seasonality, age or mating status on production or response to methyl (
               <i>E</i>)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-2-pentenoate.
