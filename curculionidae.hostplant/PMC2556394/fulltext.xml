Generally, this attraction is closely associated with herbivory and has been studied mainly under atmospheric conditions. On the other hand, the relationship between aquatic plants and insects has been little studied. To determine whether the roots of aquatic macrophytes release attractive chemical mixtures into the water, we studied the behaviour of mosquito larvae using olfactory experiments with root exudates. After testing the attraction on <italic>Culex</italic> and <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito larvae, we chose to work with <italic>Coquillettidia</italic> species, which have a complex behaviour in nature and need to be attached to plant roots in order to obtain oxygen. This relationship is non-destructive and can be described as commensal behaviour. Commonly found compounds seemed to be involved in insect attraction since root exudates from different plants were all attractive. Moreover, chemical analysis allowed us to identify a certain number of commonly found, highly water-soluble, low-molecular-weight compounds, several of which (glycerol, uracil, thymine, uridine, thymidine) were able to induce attraction when tested individually but at concentrations substantially higher than those found in nature. However, our principal findings demonstrated that these compounds appeared to act synergistically, since a mixture of these five compounds attracted larvae at natural concentrations (0.7 nM glycerol, &#x0003c;0.5 nM uracil, 0.6 nM thymine, 2.8 nM uridine, 86 nM thymidine), much lower than those found for each compound tested individually. These results provide strong evidence that a mixture of polyols (glycerol), pyrimidines (uracil, thymine), and nucleosides (uridine, thymidine) functions as an efficient attractive signal in nature for <italic>Coquillettidia</italic> larvae. We therefore show for the first time, that such commonly found compounds may play an important role in plant-insect relationships in aquatic eco-systems.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plant attractiveness to insects has been widely studied in plant-herbivore-parasitoid interactions. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) emitted by plant&#x02013;herbivore interactions are of importance for host or prey location by parasitoids and predators of phytophagous insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Vinson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Ferry1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Some plants are able to release volatile infochemicals during an attack by specific herbivorous insects that attract predators specialized on the herbivore species. These predators respond to these chemical signals by attacking the herbivores, thereby reducing the plant's tissue loss by herbivory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Kessler1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Fink1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. More than 1000 VOCs are involved in such interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-DAlessandro1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, and in a single plant&#x02013;herbivore complex 30&#x02013;50 VOCs are frequently detected by chromatographic (GC-MS) analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Ferry1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Among the wide variety of attractive compounds for terrestrial insects, the majority are represented by species-specific chemicals, mainly produced by plant secondary metabolism, such as polyphenols, isothiocyanates, terpenoids, fatty acid derivatives, benzoids and nitrogen or sulfur containing compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-DAlessandro1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Metcalf1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Bernays1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Ubiquitous metabolites such as alcohols or sugars have been shown to be involved in such interactions, but it seems that they act as phagostimulants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Chapman1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been suggested that not only is the composition of the plant signal important in the insect attractiveness by plant, but also the proportion of the different VOCs presents in the emitting signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-DeMoraes1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been demonstrated that plants emit distinct volatile blends in response to two closely related herbivore species, and that the parasitoids are able to distinguish these two signals suggesting a sophisticated chemical system of plant-herbivore-parasitoid interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Takabayashi1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In aquatic systems, VOCs dissolved in water may be responsible for air insect attraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Evans1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Rejmankova1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, non-volatile chemicals (VOCs-like), which typically have low mobility in air, may become mobile in water and might play a role in the attraction of water-living insects. In total aquatic system, studies of animal responses to chemical stimuli in aquatic systems have focused primarily on fish and non-insect invertebrates with a view to elucidating the mechanisms of chemical communication in a predator-prey relationships. In the majority of these studies, it was demonstrated that the compounds implicated in the attraction were feeding stimulants such as glycine, amino acids, sugars or organic acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Carr1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Weissburg1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Few studies have examined the orientation of herbivores to plant extracts or plant-conditioned water but all of them concerned sea water animals (i.e. sea urchins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Mann1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Klinger1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and estuarine snails <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Rahman1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>). Only one study concerning a plant-insect interaction in freshwater has been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Marko1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study the authors demonstrated that the milfoil weevil (<italic>Euhrychiopsis lecontei</italic> Dietz, 1896; Coleoptera: Curculionidae) was attracted by chemicals released by an invasive host-plant (<italic>Myriophyllum spicatum</italic> Linnaeus, 1753; Haloragaceae) for feeding, ovipositing and mating. Host plant attractions often involve a mixture of VOCs-like, and the effective concentration of one attractant can be modified, when diluted in a specific mixture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Roseland1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Bartley1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. However, this phenomenon was not observed by Marko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Marko1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, who detected no synergism between attractants in the <italic>E. lecontei-M. spicatum</italic> relationship.</p><p>There is public health concern about <italic>Coquillettidia</italic> mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) as they are potential bridge vectors of West Nile virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Apperson1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Cupp1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, Eastern Equine Encephalomyelitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Cupp2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>Dirofilaria</italic> nematodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Cancrini1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, and are widely distributed geographically.

This plant&#x02013;insect interaction appears to be regulated by the need of the continuously submerged larvae to find oxygen in the aerenchymal channels of roots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Laurence1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Such a plant&#x02013;insect relationship seems to be non-destructive for the host plant and therefore could be described as a commensalist interaction. Our previous studies have demonstrated that <italic>C. richiardii</italic> larvae are disturbed by the presence of light, since they are lucifugous and their attachment to plant roots decreased with light intensity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Srandour1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the absence of oxygen appears to initiate the search of larvae for host-plant roots to attach to.</p><p>In the present study, we examined the attraction of <italic>Coquillettidia</italic> larvae by plant root exudates from different host and non-host species, with the objective to identifying the chemical compounds involved in the attraction.

Thus, in our first experiments we tested several molecules linked to plant secondary metabolism, but none of the flavonoids and hydroxamates (potentially present in monocotyledons) tested seemed to be involved in <italic>Coquillettidia</italic> larvae orientation.

Non-volatile chemicals, which typically have low mobility in air may become mobile in water.

In aquatic systems, studies of animal responses to chemical stimuli have focused primarily on fish and non-insect invertebrates. In the majority of these studies it has been demonstrated that the compounds involved in the prey-predator interaction were feeding stimulants, such as glycine, amino acids, sugars and organic acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Carr1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Weissburg1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study, a large number of non-volatile molecules found in root exudates (organic acids, amino acids, nucleosides, sugars) were tested at various concentrations, but only a few were found to induce a behavioural attraction in <italic>Coquillettidia</italic> larvae. Our results led to the identification of glycerol, pyrimidines (uracil and thymine) and nucleosides (uridine and thymidine), as being responsible for the larval attraction. Glycerol and uracil have been previously described as attractants for the herbivore Coleoptera <italic>Euhrychiopsis lecontei</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Marko1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> with similar optimal concentrations (0.5&#x02013;1 mM and 1&#x02013;10 &#x000b5;M, respectively). On the other hand, thymine and thymidine, which were attractive at very low concentrations (0.1 nM), and uridine, which was attractive at 10 &#x000b5;M, have not previously been described as attractants. Glycerol was attractive at very high concentrations (0.5 to 1 mM) compared to the other compounds and lower concentrations did not induce a positive larval response. Even higher glycerol concentrations (10 to 50 mM), seemed to saturate the olfactory system of larvae, which became static and did not try to attach to a support. With regards to its such high effective concentrations and its chemical family, this particular compound could be considered as a food attractant for <italic>Coquillettidia</italic> larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Chapman1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Glycerol is a common metabolite that can protect plant against abiotic stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Marko1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

Pyrimidines and pyrimidine nucleosides are ubiquitous compounds in plants and both molecules were found in broadleaf cattail and maize root exudates. However, the presence of these compounds in plant exudates raised the question as to why a plant would release expensive metabolites.

Then, it was possible to consider that these compounds induced larval attraction by a synergistic process. For the first time in aquatic environment, we have made the demonstration that a synergism between the different attractive chemicals contained in the emitted signal occurred in this particular plant insect interaction.

Therefore, plant compounds released into this static environment form a concentration gradient by diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003350-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Because of the characteristics of this aquatic medium, it has been suggested that this concentration gradient could be quite stable locally. Associated with this zone, a specific bacterial flora may be present ensuring the decomposition of such compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Kumar1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Kramer1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, which could permit the stabilization of the root exudates gradient with time. Thus, <italic>Coquillettidia</italic> larvae in search of an oxygen source could have access to this specific area. Our studies demonstrated that root compound mixture diluted by a factor of 1000 was still attractive to these larvae. Moreover, S&#x000e9;randour et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003350-Srandour1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrated that <italic>Coquillettidia</italic> larvae were positively attracted by CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

We may postulate that the first step of larval attraction could be linked to a chemo-attraction signal composed of uracil, thymine, uridine, thymidine, and CO<sub>2</sub>.

Therefore, because of a stagnant aquatic system and a continuous release of plant exudates, these attractants might constitute a very stable, long-term attractive signal. This behaviour may be relieved in a second step by a nutritional signal due to high concentrations of glycerol close to the roots, because of the probable low mobility of this compound in water.
