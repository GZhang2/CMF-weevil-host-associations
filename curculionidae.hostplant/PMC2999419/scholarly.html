               <p>Foliar and soil-drench insecticide treatments were used in attempts to manipulate
                  infestation of cultivated sunflower plants, 
                  <i>Helianthus annuus</i> LeConte (Asterales: Asteraceae) by 
                  <i>Dectes texanus</i> LeConte, (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) a serious pest of sunflowers in the High Plains
                  of the USA. Seed yields were assessed on a per-plant basis for both oilseed and confection
                  type sunflower hybrids in two years. Both insecticide treatments (foliar ë-cyhalothrin
                  and soil-drench carbofuran) improved yield of oilseed sunflowers in 2004, but not
                  in 2005. Yield of confection hybrids was improved by a systemic fungicide (thiophanate
                  methyl) in 2005, but insecticides did not improve yield in either year. Both insecticide
                  treatments gave good control of various stalk-boring insects such as 
                  <i>Cylindrocopturus adspersus</i> (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), 
                  <i>Mordellistena</i> sp. (Coleoptera: Mordellidae), and 
                  <i>Pelochrista womanana</i> (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), but neither gave better than 50% control of 
                  <i>D. texanus</i>. Plants were sorted according to the presence or absence of 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> larvae and no reduction was found in total seed weight, seed size, or oil content
                  as a result of infestation. However, mature larvae of D. 
                  <i>texanus</i> girdle stalks at the base in preparation for overwintering, a behavior that reduced
                  stalk breakage force by 34–40%, leading to yield losses through lodging. At harvest
                  in 2005, there were differences between cultivars and among treatments in the proportions
                  of 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> larvae that had girdled their plants at harvest. It was concluded that further research
                  aimed at reducing crop losses to 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> should focus on means of delaying stalk desiccation and/or deterioration, factors
                  that appear to trigger girdling behavior.

               <i>Ambrosia</i> and 
               <i>Xanthium</i> spp. (Compositae) (
               <a href="#bibr05">Hatchett et al. 1975</a>), making its pest status in soybeans somewhat anomalous. Yield losses in both crops
               arise when stalks of mature plants are girdled from the interior by larvae in preparation
               for overwintering, causing plants to lodge either prior to, or during, harvest.
            </p>
            <p>There is only one generation per year, and late-instar larvae of 
               <i>D. texanus</i> overwinter in the stubble of their host plants. Adult beetles emerge over an extended
               period from late spring to mid-summer and females begin to lay eggs at about two weeks
               of age (
               <a href="#bibr02">Crook et al. 2004</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr08">Michaud and Grant 2005</a>). Little is known of the range of adult dispersal, but insects likely move only as
               far as necessary to find suitable food plants (
               <a href="#bibr08">Michaud and Grant 2005</a>). Female feeding behavior is strongly correlated with egg laying (
               <a href="#bibr08">Michaud and Grant 2005</a>) and oviposition punctures are normally initiated in feeding scars (
               <a href="#bibr05">Hatchett et al. 1975</a>). Eggs are laid in the leaf petioles (
               <a href="#bibr05">Hatchett et al. 1975</a>) and hatching larvae bore down the petiole into the core of the main stalk where
               they feed on the pith. In soybean, this behavior leads to premature leaf senescence
               and infested plants can be identified early in the season by the presence of wilted
               leaves. There is no tendency for females to avoid previously attacked plants, and
               multiple eggs are often laid by a single female in the same plant, or even the same
               petiole (
               <a href="#bibr05">Hatchett et al. 1975</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr08">Michaud and Grant 2005</a>). Larvae are highly aggressive toward conspecifics and eliminate one another by combat
               until typically only one larva remains in a plant by season's end. As the stalk dries
               down, the larva moves to the base of the plant, prepares an overwintering chamber,
               and then girdles the base of the stalk above the chamber before plugging the stalk
               cavity with shredded fibers.
            </p>
            <p>Michaud and Grant (
               <a href="#bibr08">2005</a>) showed that 
               <i>D. texanus</i> females preferred cultivated sunflower to soybean for both feeding and oviposition
               and that soybean appears to be a relatively inferior host plant for both larvae and
               adults, leading to significantly reduced pupal weight and shorter adult life. Since
               cultivated sunflower fields in the High Plains frequently have 80% or more of plants
               infested by 
               <i>D. texanus</i>, it was of interest to know whether or not the boring damage done by larvae had an
               impact on the productivity and yield of sunflower plants independent of the losses
               attributable to lodging of girdled plants. In sunflowers grown for the confection
               market, premiums are paid for large seed size, whereas in the oilseed market, premiums
               are paid for high oil content. The present study was initiated with the objective
               of measuring sunflower seed yields on a per-plant basis to determine whether or not
               
               <i>D. texanus</i> larval boring affected plant productivity in terms of either total seed weight, seed
               size, or oil content. Various insecticide treatment regimes were applied with the
               objective of generating a series of plants with and without 
               <i>D. texanus</i> larvae and then protecting the yield of these plants from other sources of damage
               until harvest. However, other species of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera also cause boring
               damage to sunflower stalks in the area of this research, potentially confounding measurements
               of 
               <i>D. texanus</i> yield impact. Primary among these are the sunflower stem weevil, 
               <i>Cylindrocopturus adspersus</i> (LeConte) the sunflower root moth, 
               <i>Pelochrista womanana</i> Kearfoot, and the tumbling flower beetle, 
               <i>Mordellistena</i> spp. Fortunately, these species are all effectively controlled by insecticide treatments
               that are far less effective against 
               <i>D. texanus</i>.

            <p>Experiments were conducted at Kansas State University, Agricultural Research Center-
               Hays, KS (38° 51′N 99° 20′W) on a crete silty clay loam soil (22% sand, 48% silt,
               and 30% clay) with pH 6.2 and 1.896 organic matter. The confection hybrid used was
               Triumph 757c and the oilseed variety was a Nusun hybrid, Triumph 665. In each year
               of the study, a field of 0.6 hectares was planted ‘no-till’ with each hybrid variety
               using a John Deere plated planter at a 76 cm row spacing. All fields were fallow the
               year prior to planting sunflowers. Prior to planting, fields were fertilized with
               57 kgs N per acre in the form of anhydrous ammonium and then given a pre-emergent
               herbicide treatment of 2.0 L / ha S-metolachlor (Dual II Magnum, Syngenta Crop Protection
               Inc., 
               <a href="www.syngenta.com">www.syngenta.com</a>) and 0.225 L / ha sulfentrazone (Spartan DF, FMC Corp., 
               <a href="www.fmc.com">www.fmc.com</a>). Following seedling emergence, plants were hand-thinned to a density of approximately
               45,000 stems / ha (confection) or 55,000 stems / ha (oilseed). In 2004, both fields
               were planted on 14 May and emergence was noted on 21 May. Seedling destruction by
               black-tailed jack rabbits, 
               <i>Lepus californiens</i>, reduced plant population to ca. 30,000 stems / ha in the confection field. The stand
               in the oilseed field was so poor that it had to be replanted on 4 June. In 2005, a
               rabbit control program was initiated in April and seedling losses were minimal. In
               order to achieve similar planting dates for each cultivar for the two years, the confection
               hybrid was planted on May 11 and the oilseed hybrid on June 6. There was sufficient
               moisture for prompt germination in both cases. Weather data was obtained for both
               growing seasons from the KSU, ARCH weather station located within 100m of the experimental
               fields.
            </p>
            <p>The experiment was laid out in a completely randomized design with five replications
               of each treatment. When plants reached the 4–6 leaf stage, a series of 15 test plots
               were staked out in each field. Each test plot consisted of a section of a row with
               30 plants or, in some cases, two adjacent rows with 15 plants in each. Plots were
               randomly assigned to one of three treatments: Control (no insecticide applied); λ-cyhalothrin
               (Warrior with Zeon technology, Syngenta) applied twice as a foliar spray at the equivalent
               of 0.288 L / ha, once at the 6-leaf stage (V6) and again at the12-leaf stage (V12),
               and carbofuran (Furadan 4F, FMC) applied twice as a soil drench at the equivalent
               of 0.720 L / ha, once at V6 and again at V12. In 2005, an additional treatment was
               added in the confection field which consisted of three soil drenches of the fungicide
               thiophanate methyl (3336F, Cleary Chemical Corp. 
               <a href="www.clearychemical.com">www.clearychemical.com</a>) at a rate equivalent to 4.8 L / ha, once each at V6, V12 and flower bud initiation
               (R1).
            </p>
            <p>At bloom, all flower heads in test plots were dusted with a 
               <i>Bacillus thuringensis</i> formulation (Dipel Dust, Southern Agricultural Insecticides Inc. 
               <a href="www.southernag.com">www.southernag.com</a>) every three days to protect against seed damage by sunflower moth, 
               <i>Homoeosoma ellectulum</i> Hulst while sparing hymenopterous pollinators. At this time, a series of 15 plants
               in each test plot were selected for continued protection from seed-damaging pests,
               henceforth referred to as ‘protected yield’ plants. Flagging tape was used to tag
               the head and stalk of each selected plant with a numerical code indicating treatment,
               plot, and plant number. At petal fall, each selected flower head was covered with
               a brown paper bag secured with staples to prevent seed loss to bird predation. Once
               plants reached physiological maturity, heads were harvested in their bags and dried
               in an oven at 38 °C for a period of 20–30 days. Harvest dates were 11 September and
               23 September, 2004 and 2 September and 13 September, 2005, for confection and oil
               cultivars, respectively. The stalks of protected plants, including the roots, were
               then uprooted and brought to the laboratory where each stalk was measured for basal
               circumference at soil level and then carefully dissected to identify and tally all
               the stalk-boring insect larvae.
            </p>
            <p>After completion of the drying process, flower heads were removed from bags, measured
               vertically and horizontally to estimate flower diameter, and then threshed individually
               using an improvised mechanical single-head threshing machine. The seed was cleaned,
               analyzed for moisture content using a Grain Analytical Computer (GAC 2000, Dickey
               John Corp. 
               <a href="www.dickey-john.com">www.dickey-john.com</a>), and then weighed on an analytical balance. A sample of 100 randomly-selected seeds
               was then counted out and weighed to provide an estimation of seed size. All seed weights
               were corrected for moisture content prior to analysis. Subsamples of 40 ml. were taken
               from each oilseed flower head and placed in a labeled envelope for subsequent determination
               of oil content by nuclear magnetic resonance (
               <a href="#bibr04">Gambhir and Agarwala 1985</a>).
            </p>
            <p>In 2005, measurements were made of stalk strength on the plants remaining in all test
               plots on the day after harvest of protected yield plants. This was accomplished with
               a digital force gauge (FGE-50X Dart, Shimpo Instruments, 
               <a href="www.shimpoinst.com">www.shimpoinst.com</a>) attached to a 16 gauge wire looped around the stalk at a height of 50 cm. Force
               was applied to the wire loop until the stalk broke, whereupon the peak force was recorded
               and the circumference of the stalk measured basally at the point of breakage. Since
               stalk breakage force demonstrates a positive linear relationship with stalk circumference,
               force measurements were divided by basal circumference in order to generate a value
               of force per unit basal circumference (henceforth referred to as the ‘adjusted stalk
               breakage force’) so that stalk strength could be compared among treatments independently
               of variation in stalk girth. Since some plants had been girdled by 
               <i>D. texanus</i> and others not, the presence / absence of girdling in the stalk was also noted. In
               the oilseed field, many girdled plants had lodged so the proportion of lodged plants
               was tallied in all plots. Data on rates of 
               <i>D. texanus</i> infestation from the protected yield plants were used in each plot to estimate the
               proportions of 
               <i>D. texanus</i> larvae that had girdled their plants prior to harvest.

                  season of 2004 began with much drier conditions in spring, but received more than
                  twice the rainfall during June and July than in 2005 (

                  special care (stalks and heads were supported off the soil) until maturity and most
                  yielded well, but it was impossible to estimate the yield impact of this wind damage

               <p>The rate of infestation of control oilseed plants by 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> was significantly higher in 2004 than in 2005 (

                  <i>P</i> = 0.001) but there was no difference between years for confection plants (

                  <i>P</i> = 0.666). Patterns of

                  <a href="#f03">Fig. 3</a>. There were significant differences among treatments in rate of infestation in oilseed

                  <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). However, treatment differences were not significant for confection plants
                  in 2004 (
                  <i>F</i> = 1.496; df = 2, 200;

                  <i>Ataxia hubbardi</i> Fisher, which also bores the central pith core of stalks, infested 23.3, 15.5 and
                  16.5 percent of plants in the control, λ-cyhalothrin, and carbofuran treatments, respectively.
                  This species was not observed in oilseed plants in either year, but is known to be
                  more aggressive than 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> in larval combat (
                  <a href="#bibr08">Michaud and Grant 2005</a>). Although the treatments did not significantly affect infestation by 
                  <i>A. hubbardi</i> in 2004 (

                  <i>D. texanus</i> were eliminated from certain plants by this species earlier in the season.

               <p>Infestation of oilseed plants by other stem-boring insects was relatively low in both

               <p>Although chemical treatments reduced infestation by 
                  <i>D. texanus</i>, they did not generate a level of differential infestation sufficient to permit analysis
                  of yield impact by plot or treatment. Consequently, plants were sorted into two groups
                  according to presence/absence of 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> larvae, ignoring treatment, using plot as a fixed factor. Analysis of data for the
                  oilseed hybrid revealed that plants with and without 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> larvae were not significantly different with respect to any component of yield in
                  either 2004 or 2005 (
                  <a href="#t01">Table 1</a>). For confection sunflowers, plants infested by 
                  <i>A. hubbardi</i> were included together with those infested by 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> since larvae of both insects cause similar plant damage by hollowing out the pith
                  core of the stalk during the growing season. Once again, there was no significant
                  effect of cerambycid infestation on any component of yield in either year (
                  <a href="#t02">Table 2</a>), except that the mean weight of 100 seeds from plants containing larvae was significantly
                  lower than that from uninfested plants in 2005, despite a non-significant trend in
                  the opposite direction in 2004.

               <p>All components of oilseed yield were higher on a per-plant basis in 2004 than in 2005,
                  except for seed weight per unit area of flower that did not differ, and oil content
                  that was significantly lower (
                  <a href="#t03a">Table 3a</a> and 
                  <a href="#t03b">Table 3b</a>). In 2004, both insecticide treatments resulted in increased stalk size, measured
                  as basal circumference, and increased yield, measured as dry weight of seed per flower,
                  without affecting seed size, as estimated by weight of 100 seeds, or oil content.
                  This yield increase was associated with an increase in flower size in the λ-cyhalothrin
                  treatment, but not in the carbofuran treatment, where it was associated with an increase
                  in flower productivity (seed weight per unit area of head). There were no significant
                  effects of treatment on seed oil content in 2004. In 2005, the λ-cyhalothrin treatment
                  appeared to reduce components of yield compared to the carbofuran and control treatments.
                  This yield reduction was accompanied by reductions in flower size, weight of 100 seeds,
                  and productivity per unit area of flower head. In 2005, the carbofuran treatment improved
                  seed oil content over that observed in either control or λ-cyhalothrin-treated flowers
                  that did not differ from each other.

                  treatment affected any component of yield significantly in 2004, but sample sizes
                  were reduced by wind damage in that year. In 2005, the thiophanate methyl treatment
                  produced more weight of seed per flower than either the control or carbofuran treatments,
                  apparently as a result of greater flower productivity measured as seed weight per

                  <i>D. texanus</i> girdling. This was significantly greater than the 7.9% lodging observed in λ-cyhalothrin-treated

               <p>Although both insecticide treatments appeared effective in controlling infestation
                  by sunflower stem weevil, tumbling flower beetle, and root moth, neither could be
                  considered adequate for control of 
                  <i>D. texanus</i>. 
                  <i>λ</i>-cyhalothrin has been shown to have high toxicity to 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> in the laboratory (Kazmareck et al. 2004) but adult beetles are active in the field
                  for an extended period in summer and may have laid eggs in plants during periods when
                  residual activity of the material was low. Failure of application timing to correspond
                  adequately with female 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> activity is the most likely explanation for the failure of λ-cyhalothrin to reduce
                  rates of larval infestation in oilseed plants in 2005 and in confection plants in
                  either year, although why this treatment appeared to increase infestation in confection
                  plants in 2005 is difficult to surmise. Campbell and van Duyn (
                  <a href="#bibr01">1977</a>) tested various insecticides and application techniques against 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> in soybeans and concluded that their treatments were ineffective against larvae and
                  that numerous, carefully timed applications would be necessary to control adults.
               </p>
               <p>The carbofuran treatment targeted larvae within plants and was applied as a soil drench
                  to obtain good systemic activity. It may be that failure of this material to provide
                  adequate control of 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> is partially derived from the larva's propensity to confine its feeding to the central
                  pith core of the plant, avoiding conductive tissues that would presumably contain
                  most of the insecticide. Rogers (1975) noted that systemic insecticides were ineffective
                  in controlling 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> larvae in either soybean or sunflower. The two-fold reduction in stalk circumference
                  in oilseed plants in 2005 relative to 2004 may have brought more larvae into contact
                  with conductive elements of the stalk and resulted in better control in the former
                  year. Some of the differences observed in insecticide efficacy between the two years
                  may also have resulted from differences in environmental conditions. The higher summer
                  rainfall of 2004 compared to 2005 would be expected to result in more rapid weathering
                  of λ-cyhalothrin residues on foliage, and perhaps improve plant uptake of the carbofuran
                  soil drenches. However, such effects do not appear implicated in levels of 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> control because λ-cyhalothrin was generally less effective in 2005, whereas the reverse
                  was true for carbofuran.

               <p>When treatments were pooled and all plants with cerambycid larvae were compared to
                  those without, there was no effect of 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> larval boring on any component of yield (
                  <a href="#t01">Tables 1</a> and 
                  <a href="#t02">2</a>) except in confection plants in 2005 when plants with larvae had reduced seed weights
                  compared to those uninfested. However, the magnitude of the difference was small (0.2
                  gm) and the opposite trend, although non-significant, was evident in 2004, suggesting
                  variation due to chance effects.

               <p>There are various possible explanations for why rate of 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> infestation was lower in oilseed plants in 2005 than in 2004 while this was not the
                  case in confection plants. If the peak period of female oviposition occurred later
                  in 2004, females may have oviposited more eggs in the later-planted oilseed cultivar
                  relative to the confection cultivar in response to their earlier stage of development.
                  However, it is also possible that the small stalks of oilseed plants in 2005 reduced
                  their acceptabilty for oviposition by 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> females.

               <p>Both insecticide treatments increased the seed yield of oilseed plants in 2004, although
                  neither did so in 2005. Interestingly, the mechanisms of yield increase in 2004 appeared
                  slightly different for the two materials tested; the λ-cyhalothrin treatment resulted
                  in larger flowers than control plants, whereas the carbofuran treatment resulted in
                  flowers that were more productive per unit area of head (Table 3). Both insecticide
                  treatments increased stalk girth. Given the absence of stalk-feeding insects in control
                  plants (apart from 
                  <i>D. texanus</i>), it seems likely that insects feeding on other plant parts were implicated in the
                  observed yield losses. Although the foliar λ-cyhalothrin treatment would presumably
                  be limited to impacts on foliage-feeding insects, the carbofuran soil drenches would
                  presumably affect root, stem, and foliage insects to some degree. Thus defoliation
                  might primarily impact flower size, whereas root and stem feeding might have more
                  impact on flower productivity in terms of seed fill.
               </p>
               <p>Although no particular folivorous insect was observed in numbers approaching an economic
                  injury level in 2004, a complex of larval Lepidoptera were observed defoliating plants
                  and may have collectively been responsible for reducing the mean stalk circumference,
                  flower diameter, and seed weight of control oilseed plants. The primary species observed
                  included 
                  <i>Estigmene acrea</i> (Drury) (Lepidoptera, Arctiidae) and 
                  <i>Vanessa cardui</i> L. (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae). Muma et al. (
                  <a href="#bibr09">1950</a>) found variable effects of foliar insecticide treatment on sunflower yields in Nebraska
                  that they attributed to differential impacts on lepidopterous larvae and their natural
                  enemies in different years. However, only the λ-cyhalothrin treatment would have impacted
                  beneficial insects active on sunflower foliage as the carbofuran was applied as a
                  soil drench.
               </p>
               <p>It is notable that the seed weight of oilseed sunflowers was 222% higher in 2004 relative
                  to 2005, whereas it was only 11% higher for confection sunflowers in 2004 which was
                  a superior growing season. However, it is difficult to understand this contrast because
                  of the wind damage to confection plants during seed maturation in 2004 and because
                  variability in stand establishment between the two hybrids in both years probably
                  had significant effects on plant size. Since the thiophanate methyl treatment produced
                  the highest seed yield in confection flowers in 2005, it is possible that stalk- and
                  root-infecting fungi were more limiting to yield than were insects in that particular
                  field and year. However, the effectiveness of both insecticide treatments in increasing
                  the yield of oilseed plants in 2004 suggests that herbivorous insects (other than
                  
                  <i>D. texanus</i>) were limiting to yield in that particular year. The lack of such treatment effects
                  in 2005 is consistent with factors other than herbivory, most likely soil moisture,
                  being more limiting to yield. The reduced yields of λ-cyhalothrin-treated oilseed
                  plants relative to controls in 2005 is difficult to explain, but may reflect a chance
                  effect of these treatment plots being located in less productive parts of the field.
                  Some bract necrosis induced by heat scorch was observed on oilseed flowers in 2005
                  and this damage impeded the development of some flowers, particularly in two λ-cyhalothrin
                  plots.
               </p>
               <p>Reliable yield data for confection plants was obtained only in 2005 and the λ-cyhalothrin
                  treatment produced the best combination of seed weight and seed size, again suggesting
                  the potential benefits of protecting foliage. The positive correlation between numbers
                  of 
                  <i>C. adspersus</i> larvae and total weight of seed from control confection plants probably reflects
                  the tendency of bigger stalks to harbor larger numbers of larvae, and clearly indicates
                  that a mean of 19 larvae per stalk is well below an economic impact threshold for
                  this pest. The consistent positive relationship between basal stalk circumference
                  and flower diameter suggests that wider plant spacing is one tactic for increasing
                  stalk girth along with flower size for confection varieties where seed size is also
                  correlated with flower diameter. However, a negative relationship between flower diameter
                  and seed oil content was evident in 2004 when oilseed flowers ranged between 20 and
                  30 cm in diameter, consistent with the inference that such large flowers are not desirable
                  for oil production. Mean seed oil content was 13.4% higher in 2005 when most flowers
                  ranged between 10 and 20 cm in diameter and the negative correlation with flower diameter
                  disappeared, suggesting that this relationship might only be a concern when flowers
                  become larger than 20 cm.

               <p>Fungicide treatment increased the breakage forces of ungirdled stalks significantly
                  more than either insecticide treatment in the 2005 confection plants, suggesting that
                  fungi may play a role in stalk deterioration at crop maturity that is worthy of further
                  investigation. Similarly, the generally higher stalk breakage forces obtained from
                  the carbofuran treatments compared to the λ-cyhalothrin treatments are likely a function
                  of the systemic activity of the former material in delaying various processes associated
                  with stalk degradation, but data from multiple years would be required to confirm
                  this.
               </p>
               <p>Girdling by 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> larvae reduced stalk breakage forces by 34–40%. However, larvae appear physically
                  unable to fully girdle sunflower stalks that are greater than 2.5 cm in diameter.
                  Similarly, Wapshere (
                  <a href="#bibr15">1974</a>) noted that larvae of the cerambycid 
                  <i>Mecas saturnina</i> LeConte were only able to partially girdle cocklebur plants with stems &gt; 2.0 cm in
                  diameter. Confection sunflowers are planted at lower densities than oilseed plants
                  with the goal of obtaining larger heads that, as our data clearly show, are not only
                  associated with larger seeds, the criterion for premiums in confection markets, but
                  also with thicker stalks. Farmers specializing in the production of confection sunflowers
                  usually manage to avoid lodging problems simply because stout confection stalks are
                  robust enough to remain standing even when girdled by a 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> larva. Note also that the stalk breakage forces tended to be 50% higher for the confection
                  hybrid than for the oilseed hybrid after adjustment for differences in plant size,
                  suggesting that the former were intrinsically stronger. Lodging losses caused by 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> are, therefore, a more serious concern for farmers growing oilseed cultivars, especially
                  when they depend upon rain, as moisture is often limiting. Oilseed sunflowers grown
                  at high density under dry conditions not only have slender stalks that can be completely
                  girdled by 
                  <i>D. texanus</i>, but their stalks also dry out quickly after crop maturity, likely triggering earlier
                  onset of the girdling behavior (see below). Reduction of planting density to increase
                  stalk girth is one possible tactic for oilseed farmers, provided flower diameter head
                  does not increase above 20 cm.
               </p>
               <p>In 2005, a large proportion of untreated plants in the oilseed field had lodged by
                  time of harvest, whereas this was not the case in untreated confection plants despite
                  similar rates of 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> infestation. Although the larger girth of confection stalks may be implicated here,
                  it was also apparent that fewer larvae had completed girdling in the confection hybrid
                  than in the oilseed hybrid by date of harvest. There were also marked differences
                  among treatments in completion of stalk girdling by larvae in the oilseed plants in
                  2005, as both insecticide treatments appearing to delay the behavior. One explanation
                  consistent with these observations is that girdling behavior may be triggered by stalk
                  desiccation because this determines the end of its suitability as a food source. We
                  have often reared 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> larvae on fresh sunflower stalks in the laboratory, but have never managed to elicit
                  feeding on dry stalk material. In contrast, larvae of 
                  <i>A. hubbardi</i> do not girdle plants and readily feed and gain weight when provided with completely
                  dry stalk pith (AKG, personal observation). The absence of lodging in both cultivars
                  in 2004 is consistent with the moist conditions that prevailed up until harvest in
                  that year. The oilseed stalks in 2005 suffered substantial lodging, but were considerably
                  more slender than confection stalks, and also notably more dry and brittle at time
                  of harvest. Both large plant size and pesticide treatment might delay stalk desiccation
                  and this effect could explain the observed delays in girdling behavior in confection
                  plants relative to oilseed plants and in pesticide treatments relative to controls.
                  Similarly, Richardson (
                  <a href="#bibr12">1975</a>) concluded that desiccation of pith within stems represented the end of a suitable
                  food supply and was a likely trigger for 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> girdling behavior in soybeans. Anecdotal support for this interpretation is provided
                  by observations of commercial fields where non-irrigated regions and dry spots typically
                  exhibit lodging much earlier than moist or irrigated portions, despite similar rates
                  of larval infestation.
               </p>
               <p>Given that larval boring by 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> larvae has no measurable impact on yield, further research directed at mitigating
                  losses to this pest should focus on factors triggering the girdling behavior and possible
                  means of delaying or otherwise manipulating this behavior. Possibilities for further
                  investigation include systemic materials that delay stalk deterioration, dessicants
                  that accelerate drying of flower heads relative to stalks, or the development of cultivars
                  with ‘stay-green’ stalks. The common objective of these approaches would be to delay
                  the onset of girdling behavior by 
                  <i>D. texanus</i> larvae until well after seed has dried down to harvestable levels.
