               <p>The multi-trophic relationship between insects, yeast, and filamentous fungi is reported
                  on sabal palm (
                  <i>Sabal palmetto</i> (Walter) Lodd. ex Schult. &amp; Schult. f.). Gut content analyses and observations of
                  adult and larval feeding of the sap beetle 
                  <i>Brachypeplus glaber</i> LeConte indicate that niche partitioning of fungal food substrata occurs between
                  adults and larvae. This is the first report of specific mycophagous niche partitioning
                  among beetle life stages based on gut content analyses. Fungi isolated from the beetle
                  gut of adults, larvae, and pupae include species of 
                  <i>Fusarium</i> Link, 
                  <i>Cladosporium</i> Link, and 
                  <i>Penicillium</i> Link, which were differentially ingested by larvae and adults; 
                  <i>Fusarium solani</i> and 
                  <i>Penicillium</i> species in larvae, whereas 
                  <i>F. oxysoproum</i>, F. 
                  <i>verticillioides</i>, and 
                  <i>Cladosporium</i> in adults. These data indicate the first species-level host data for 
                  <i>Brachypeplus</i> Erichson species. 
                  <i>Fusarium proliferatum</i> (Matsush.) Nirenberg was the most commonly occurring fungal gut component, being
                  isolated from the palm as well as gut of larvae, pupae, and adults; representing a
                  commonly shared food resource. One species of yeast, 
                  <i>Meyerozyma caribbica</i> (Vaughan-Mart. et al.) Kurtzman &amp; Suzuki (basionym = 
                  <i>Pichia caribbica</i>), was isolated from all life stages and is likely responsible for anti-fungal properties
                  observed in the pupae and represents a promising source of antifungal compounds; rearing
                  and diagnostic protocols are provided to aid biomedical researchers. Feeding and cleaning
                  behaviors are documented using time-lapse video-micrography, and discussed in a behavioral
                  and functional morphological context. Adults spent long periods feeding, often &gt;1/3
                  of the two-hour observation period. A generic adult body posture was observed during
                  feeding, and included substrate antennation before and after ingestion. Adult grooming
                  behaviors were manifested in distinct antennal and tarsal cleaning mechanisms. Larval
                  behaviors were different from adults, and larvae feeding on 
                  <i>Fusarium</i> fungi immediately ceased all subsequent feeding. This is the first ethogram for any
                  adult or larval sap beetle.

            <p>Resource partitioning as an advantageous life history adaptation within holometabolous
               insects is well-known as a mechanism for reducing competition between adults and progeny
               for the same food resource. However, little detailed information regarding specific
               empirical examples is available to support this hypothesis. In general, partitioning
               of resources increases survivorship of offspring and enables them to proliferate on
               different substrates than adults. This phenomenon has never been observed within sap
               beetles (for both sap beetle and host) or within any other mycophagous beetle lineage
               at the species level utilizing the same microhabitat.
            </p>
            <p>Sap beetles (Nitidulidae) exhibit a dramatic breadth of ecological niches, more than
               any other beetle family, including: mycophagy, saprophagy, frugivory, anthophagy,
               predation, herbivory, necrophagy, pollination, and inquilinism with social Hymenoptera
               (bees and ants) and Isoptera (termites) 
               <a href="#pone.0089295-Audisio1">[1]</a>–
               <a href="#pone.0089295-Jelnek1">[3]</a>. Saprophagy is known from multiple lineages, including more than 20 genera from at
               least 6 different sap beetle subfamilies. Associations between sap beetles and soil
               ecology are undoubtedly important, as evidenced in the genus 
               <i>Stelidota</i> Erichson which is found in great abundance in soil and leaf litter samples, often
               being the most dominant beetle component in these samples 
               <a href="#pone.0089295-Medianero1">[4]</a>. Fungal hyphae have been retrieved from the pro- and midgut of adults and larvae
               of this genus. The abundance and species diversity of 
               <i>Stelidota</i>, could help provide useful insights into conservation efforts of regions and sites
               based on the health of the soil and litter fauna 
               <a href="#pone.0089295-Didham1">[5]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0089295-Anderson1">[6]</a>. Sap beetle associations with ascomycete fungi have been documented for some genera,
               i.e. 
               <i>Glischrochilus</i> Reitter, 
               <i>Epuraea</i> Erichson, 
               <i>Colopterus</i> Erichson, and 
               <i>Carpophilus</i> Stephens on 
               <i>Ceratocystis</i> (Ellis and Halst.) oak wilt mats 
               <a href="#pone.0089295-Dorsey1">[7]</a>–
               <a href="#pone.0089295-Heath1">[10]</a>. More recently, some studies have focused on fungal isolates, i.e. 
               <i>Beauvaria</i> Vuill. from a single sap beetle species, i.e. 
               <i>Meligethes aeneus</i> ( =  
               <i>Brassicogethes aeneus</i>: 
               <a href="#pone.0089295-Audisio2">[11]</a>), that were not correlated to food intake 
               <a href="#pone.0089295-Meyling1">[12]</a>. We found no sap beetle studies involving fungal associations that have focused on
               both the larval and adult gut.
            </p>
            <p>
               <i>Brachypeplus</i> Erichson is a large sap beetle genus comprised of more than 100 species distributed
               worldwide. Highest species diversity occurs in the Old and New World tropics. New
               World members of 
               <i>Brachypeplus</i> have only recently received much attention 
               <a href="#pone.0089295-Cline2">[13]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0089295-Cline3">[14]</a>. Species in this genus are known to occur in association with palm vegetative or
               reproductive structures, specifically within the subcortical confines of dead and/or
               decaying plants. All species possess bodies that are highly flattened to gain entry
               into these confined microhabitats, and once inside persist on fungi and other components
               
               <a href="#pone.0089295-Cline3">[14]</a>. The secretive habits of the North American species, 
               <i>B. glaber</i> LeConte, are evidenced by the fact that until D. Habeck began looking into sabal
               palm [(
               <i>Sabal palmetto</i> (Walter) Lodd. ex Schult. &amp; Schult. f.) (Arecaceae)] inflorescences in the 1960’s
               and 1970’s, the species was only known from 3 specimens.
            </p>
            <p>Following an initially well-defined morphology project this research evolved into
               a thorough evaluation of the species that led to behavioral and ecological discoveries
               with broader ramifications to insect biology and evolution. Herein, we provide details
               on the interactions of 
               <i>Brachypeplus glaber</i> with other organisms within the confines of a sabal palm, the biogeography of the
               beetle and host plant, mycophagous niche partitioning between life history stages,
               pupal antifungal properties, laboratory rearing protocols, life table data, and natural
               product discovery through an understanding of a species’ natural history.

               <p>Locality data from collections or specimen lists were entered into an Excel file.
                  GPS information not already provided on specimen labels was determined using online

               <p>Final instar larvae and adults were kept alive for feeding and general behavioral
                  observations. Adults were kept in Petri dishes (100×15 mm) containing either a combination
                  of fragments of host plant material possessing live scale insects, shed scale exuviae,
                  and active fungal growth; or artificial media and cultured fungal colonies. Each dish
                  containing palm fragments was watered once per week to replenish moisture to the host
                  plant and fungal substrates. Larvae were kept in standard size Petri dishes containing
                  artificial media and cultured fungal colonies derived only from the gut contents of
                  previously dissected adults and larvae. Using fungi from gut contents ensured that
                  larvae would be exposed to preferred fungal substrates, and thereby increase survivability.
                  Initial observations of adults and larvae were performed using a Nikon® SMZ 1500 stereo
                  microscope. Some individuals were subsequently digitally recorded using a Panasonic
                  PV-GS700 camcorder attached to a Leica MZ15 stereoscope. These digital recordings
                  were used to determine measurements and timing of behaviors, and as a reference for
                  functional morphology of gut action. Adult feeding behaviors were observed at 1–2
                  hour intervals, once a week, over a two week period. Two males and two females, four
                  total adults, were observed with a Nikon SMZ 1500 stereo microscope to associate body
                  postures with observed behaviors. Likewise, four total larval specimens were used
                  to define larval behaviors. Due to the rarity of pupal forms found, only a single
                  pupa was observed. This pupa was derived from existing larvae in the lab and was not
                  collected from a palm in situ. All insects were denied access to food sources for
                  one day prior to the observation period to encourage feeding.

               <p>Gut dissections were performed on live adults, pupae, and larvae using a Nikon® SMZ
                  1500 stereo microscope. Prior to dissection and between dissecting events, all dissecting
                  tools and implements were flame sterilized to prevent contamination. For adults, the
                  head was removed and portions of the foregut, midgut, and hindgut were subsequently
                  removed from the body cavity with ultrafine forceps (Dumont® #5SF) and custom made
                  angled and hook-shaped minuten pin implements attached to a nickel plated pin holder
                  (Moria®). For larvae, the head was removed, and the thoracic and abdominal body segments
                  splayed open via a longitudinal section down the midline of the ventrites. The fore,
                  mid, and anterior portion of the hind gut of third instar larvae were removed using
                  ultra-fine forceps and minuten pin tools. The dissections were performed ventral side
                  up for all life stages to prevent unnecessary tearing of the gut wall due to its proximity
                  to the more heavily sclerotized tergites, to assure visualization of the organs, and
                  to preserve as much of the fragile pro, mid, and hindgut as possible. A total of 6
                  mature (i.e. non-teneral) adults, 6 larvae, and 1 pupae were dissected. Gut fragments
                  were placed in distilled sterile water and processed as described below.

               <p>Each beetle gut was placed in a 1.5 ml tube containing 1 ml sterile distilled water.
                  The gut was gently macerated with a sterile disposable pestle to release its contents.
                  Aliquots (0.3 ml) of full strength solution were plated onto duplicate plates of half-strength
                  acidified potato dextrose agar (aPDA) (BD Difco, Sparks, MD). Two serial 10-fold dilutions
                  were also prepared and spread on duplicate plates of aPDA. Plates were incubated at
                  23°C under a UV light. After 7 days, morphologically distinct fungal colonies from
                  each gut extraction were transferred onto aPDA. Genomic DNA was extracted from mycelium
                  of 10 day-old colonies using the DNeasy Plant Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For 
                  <i>Fusarium</i> species, a portion of translation elongation factor (EF) 1a coding region and introns
                  were amplified with primers EF-1 and EF-2 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-ODonnell1">[16]</a>. Cycling conditions included an initial denaturation for 3 min at 95°C, followed
                  by 35 cycles of denaturation (95°C) for 20 s, annealing (58°C) for 30 s and extension
                  (72°C) for 40 s. A final extension was performed at 72°C for 5 min. For yeasts and
                  non-
                  <i>Fusarium</i> filamentous fungal isolates, internal transcribed spacer region primers ITS1 and
                  ITS4 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-White1">[17]</a> were used to amplify the ITS region including the 5.8S gene. Cycling conditions included
                  an initial denaturation for 2 min. at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation
                  (94°C) for 30 s, annealing (52°C) for 30 s and extension (72°C) for 60 s. A final
                  extension was performed at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were purified using a QIAquick
                  Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Sequencing reactions were performed using
                  an ABI 3730 Capillary Electrophoresis Genetic Analyzer and Big Dye Terminator V3.0
                  sequencing chemistry. Sequences were analyzed by performing BLAST queries in GenBank
                  and FUSARIUM-ID 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Geiser1">[18]</a>. All sequences were deposited in GenBank (see

                  <p>Upon introduction onto a Petri dish containing fungal components, one male beetle
                     fed for approximately 20 min., took a short 2–3 min. break, and resumed feeding for
                     another 22 min, finally ending in a period of rest with the body still. A second male
                     initially fed for approximately 8 min, took a 12 min. break, and resumed feeding for
                     another 24 min, ending in a period of rest. One female initially fed for approximately
                     8 min. then walked around before becoming stationary for the rest of the 2 hr. observation
                     period. A second female likewise fed for a brief period of 7 min then walked to the
                     edge of the Petri dish and remained motionless for the remaining 1 hr observation
                     period.
                  </p>
                  <p>Both the first male and second female were observed feeding on the shed exuviae of
                     the scale insect, 
                     <i>Comstockiella sabalis</i> Comstock (Diaspididae), during the observation period. In these instances, the shed
                     exuvium was completely ingested, as well as 
                     <i>Fusarium</i> (sp. 1) hyphae present on the exuviae. The ingestion was completed within one min.
                     for both beetles, and there was no correlated body posture or other functional morphological
                     manifestation during the process. Feeding events that included exuviae consumption
                     ceased all other feeding activities on fungi. Both beetles consumed the shed exuviae
                     in the same manner as fungal substrates, i.e. no observed functional morphological
                     or behavioral differences.
                  </p>
                  <p>Both male beetles were observed at separate time periods feeding in damp areas of
                     the Petri dish that were partially submerged in drops of water. Feeding within submerged
                     areas continued in the same manner within water as it did when the beetle was not
                     submerged. One male consistently extruded its genitalic capsule (i.e. ventrite 8 and
                     tergite 8) slightly outside of the body cavity during feeding. The median lobe and
                     tegmen, however remained within the capsule and were never extruded. Another male,
                     during a short break in feeding, flexed its abdomen in an upward bow shape and partially
                     unfurled its mesothoracic flight wings. This occurred several times during short feeding
                     breaks. Several minutes (∼14 min) after cessation of feeding activities, this male
                     was the only beetle observed to produce fecal material. The second male specimen was
                     also observed feeding on the cast larval head capsule of a conspecific; however the
                     head capsule was not fully consumed. All four test specimens were observed feeding
                     on fungal particles that had accumulated on their conspecific’s dorsum while in the
                     Petri dish.
                  </p>
                  <p>Adult functional morphology during feeding was expressed with a somewhat generic body
                     posture in which the legs remained stationary to the sides, while the beetle fed from
                     directly in front of its head, i.e. prognathous style. The antennae only infrequently
                     tapped the substrate (every 10–15 s), and were typically held in a position 90° to
                     120° forward from a longitudinal transect down the midline of the body, and roughly
                     10° to 30° degrees superior to a transverse sagittal plane of the body. The mandibles
                     and maxillae moved in concert with each other, and the terminal maxillary palpomere
                     extended beyond the mandibular apices during periods of initial food consumption,
                     and was the first mouthpart sclerite to come into direct contact with the food source.
                     This probing by the terminal palpomere likely coincides with determination of food
                     source suitability, as the palpomere apex is completely covered with sensory setae.
                     Food particles were often manipulated and reoriented, via a combination of movements
                     of the mandibles and maxillae, to more easily fit within the oral cavity. Due to the
                     relatively light sclerotization of the beetle head and pronotum (which made the beetle
                     somewhat transparent) as well as the use of both ring lights and directional fiber
                     optic light, visualization of the foregut was possible at certain angles. Food items
                     entering the oral cavity typically spent 1–2 s in the esophagus and oral cavity.

                  <p>Cleaning behaviors expressed by all adults consisted of tarsal and antennal club grooming.
                     Cleaning of the antennal club was accomplished by two different mechanisms. One mechanism
                     involved the terminal two tarsomeres (including the claw) of the protarsi grasping
                     one antenna from above and sliding the antenna through the tarsomeres in an anterior/inferior
                     motion. The other mechanism involved using one or the other protarsi to push the antenna
                     (from segment 6–7) between the mandibles and maxillae in an anterior/inferior (AI)
                     motion or an anterior/superior (AS) motion such that the entire antennal club is brought
                     between the mouthparts from either above or below the head. The frequency of occurrence
                     of the AS motion is far less than the AI motion, such that the antennal club was 4–5
                     times more likely to be cleaned in a downward motion than upward motion of the antenna
                     through the mouthparts (n = 14, AI = 12, AS = 2). All antennal cleaning behaviors
                     were expressed in both genders, with no particular behavior relegated to one sex or
                     the other.
                  </p>
                  <p>Tarsomere cleaning was observed for each leg. Protarsomeres were cleaned via three
                     different mechanisms. One method involved bringing the terminal 3 tarsomeres, including
                     the claw, between the mandibles and maxillae in a superior to inferior motion (i.e.
                     mouthparts clean tarsi). Another method included rubbing the protarsomeres of the
                     right and left legs together in a vigorous back and forth motion (i.e. ‘hand washing’
                     motion to clean tarsi of same body segment) beneath the head. The third method was
                     to clean the protarsomeres with the mesotarsomeres of the corresponding side of the
                     body in a vigorous back and forth motion similar to that of the protarsi to protarsi
                     motion above (i.e. ‘hand washing’ motion with tarsi of different body segments). Protarsal
                     to mesotarsal cleaning occurred on both the left and right sides of the body. The
                     mesotarsi were cleaned on the metatibial comb on the corresponding side of the body
                     in a superior to inferior motion from proximal to distal regions of the comb on the
                     metatibiae. Mesotarsi and metarsi were also cleaned by a similar hand washing motion
                     of tarsi from the same body segment beneath the body proper. All tarsal cleaning behaviors
                     were expressed in both genders, with no particular behavior relegated to one sex or
                     the other.
                  </p>
                  <p>General behaviors expressed by adults were observed in Petri dishes containing cultured
                     fungi (
                     <a href="#pone-0089295-g002">Fig. 2C</a>), as well as Petri dishes containing palmetto fragments with fungal and other debris
                     present. Most of the observation periods were spent either feeding or remaining stationary
                     (&gt;95%), with little time spent walking around the Petri dish. During stationary periods,
                     the beetle’s antennae often vibrated in short frequency such that under high-power
                     magnification the antennae appeared to shake. This may be a mechanism for breaking
                     up laminar air flow around the antennae, which creates turbulence and thereby increases
                     the likelihood of detecting volatiles in the surrounding air through sensory receptors
                     on the antennal club segments (i.e. segments 9, 10, and 11). No air-flow tests were
                     performed to confirm this hypothesis, rather this assertion is based solely on behavioral
                     observations and the known morphological adaptations of the Nitidulidae antenna.

                  <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">Larvae</div>
                  <p>Feeding behaviors expressed by larvae were typically short-lived, lasting only 3–4
                     min. Of the four larvae observed, one larva fed on 
                     <i>Fusarium</i> sp. 1 for 8 min. As with adults, food particles remained in the foregut for a very
                     short period of time, typically never more than 2–3 s. Larvae preferentially fed on
                     
                     <i>Fusarium</i> Link and 
                     <i>Penicillium</i> Link species, with the largest proportion of time spent feeding on 
                     <i>Fusarium</i> hyphae (approximately 2∶1 preference duration, 476 s on 
                     <i>Fusarium</i> to 230 s on 
                     <i>Penicillium</i>, n = 4). Feeding progressed in a prognathous manner as in adults, however the mandibles
                     and maxillae in the larvae extended forward to a similar length to come in contact
                     with the substrate at the same time/place. Any consumption of 
                     <i>Fusarium</i> hyphae by larval specimens caused subsequent cessation of all feeding activities.
                     No cleaning behaviors were observed in any of the larval specimens. Larvae spent less
                     time in ambulatory movement than adults, and most time was spent either motionless
                     or feeding (&gt;99% of observation time). General behaviors expressed by larvae were
                     observed solely in Petri dishes containing fungi that were cultured from larval gut
                     contents. No larval behaviors were recorded on palms or palm cuttings.

               <div class="pupae" title="sec">
                  <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">Pupae</div>
                  <p>Pupal behavior was observed in a Petri dish containing cultured fungi, i.e. 
                     <i>Fusarium proliferatum</i>, 
                     <i>Fusarium solani</i> (Mart.) Sacc., and 
                     <i>Penicillium</i>. The beetle pupated venter side down with the last larval skin pushed to the apex
                     of the pupal abdomen, but still attached to terminal abdominal tergite and ventrite.
                     Activity was expressed in the flexion of the abdomen in a curling manner towards the
                     ventral surface of the head and thorax. In a 36 hr period, the newly developed pupa
                     discarded the last larval skin and moved approximately 1 cm from it. In the subsequent
                     10 hours the pupa flipped from a ventral side down posture with the abdomen flexed
                     and the body in an inverted “U” position to a prostrate flattened posture with ventral
                     side up. Although perhaps insignificant in distance, the movement away from the final
                     cast larval skin may be biologically important. Specifically, the observed occurrence
                     of adults feeding on cast larval skin may warrant quick disposal and dispersal away
                     from the shed skin to avoid potential predation (whether inadvertent or not) by conspecific
                     adults. Also, within the roughly two day period from pupal emergence to a flattened
                     prostrate position, the final cast larval skin began producing copious 
                     <i>Fusarium</i> hyphae and spores. Thus, movement away from the final cast larval skin may have provided
                     the newly emerged pupa an opportunity to distance itself from fungi that had once
                     been consumed and/or impregnated the outer cuticle, and which could potentially consume
                     the quiescent pupa. This behavior was not observed within the confines of the sabal
                     palm inflorescence where flexion and curling may be severely restricted depending
                     on the degree of separation of the inflorescence sheaves. Pupal mobility is not unknown
                     in Coleoptera 
                     <a href="#pone.0089295-Crowson1">[19]</a>, but has never been previously observed in Nitidulidae.
                  </p>
                  <p>One chemically mediated pupal behavior was observed via the secretion of an antifungal
                     agent to the immediate surrounding Petri dish environment. Approximately 10 days after
                     the transition from larva to pupa the Petri dish was reexamined and the pupa remained
                     viable, however the Petri dish had begun to be over taken by fungal growth, except
                     for a distinct fungal free zone immediately around the pupa (
                     <a href="#pone-0089295-g004">Fig. 4</a>). Although some fungal hyphae permeated the media underneath the pupa, no surface
                     hyphae or fruiting bodies breached came in contact with the pupa.

               <p>The internal gut flora that was determined for both adults and larvae is categorized

                  <a href="#pone-0089295-t001">Table 1</a> should be used as a reference for each component. Sequences of the translation elongation
                  factor (EF) gene or ITS regions for most isolates were deposited into GenBank. Most
                  of the filamentous fungi isolated from the gut flora were members of the genus 
                  <i>Fusarium</i>. 
                  <i>Fusarium</i> species include plant and animal pathogens, common soil and environmental inhabitants,
                  and important mycotoxin producers. The use of alpha elongation factor gene sequencing
                  in 
                  <i>Fusarium</i> identification is typically necessary as morphological characters alone are often
                  not sufficient for accurate identification.

                  <i>Fusarium proliferatum</i> (Matsush.) Nirenberg, also known as 
                  <i>Gibberella intermedia</i> (Kuhlmann) Samuels, was the most commonly isolated fungus in our study. This species
                  was isolated from every sample, including adult beetle gut, pupal gut, larval gut,
                  and hyphae directly plated from live palm samples. 
                  <i>Fusarium proliferatum</i> exhibits a worldwide distribution and causes many plant diseases, particularly on
                  monocots, including rice, maize, onions, garlic and palm 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Stankovic1">[20]</a>. This species is also an important producer of the mycotoxins fumonisin B1, fusaproliferin,
                  beauvericin and fusaric acid 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Stankovic1">[20]</a>. Most sequences of 
                  <i>F. proliferatum</i> isolates (CDFA865, 873, 876, 880, 882, and 883) obtained from beetle guts were identical
                  and most closely matched 
                  <i>F. proliferatum</i> sequences obtained from other insects (NRRL 52687, NRRL25103)

                  <i>Fusarium verticillioides</i> (Sacc.) Nirenberg, also known as 
                  <i>Gibberella moniliformis</i> Wineland, was isolated from adult beetle guts and live palm samples. This fungus
                  is particularly important on corn as it causes a pervasive stalk and cob rot resulting
                  in significant yield reductions and grain quality 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Leslie1">[22]</a>. 
                  <i>Fusarium verticillioides</i> is a widely recognized mycotoxin producer, especially fumonisins 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Leslie1">[22]</a>, 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-SanchezRangel1">[23]</a>, as well as being responsible for ∼20% of 
                  <i>Fusarium</i> infection in humans 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Galimberti1">[24]</a>. Many insect taxa play a major role in dispersal of this pathogen and subsequent

                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Munkvold1">[25]</a>. Volatile compounds that are produced by 
                  <i>F. verticilloides</i> are thought to be attractants to many insect species (Bartlet et al 1999) 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Bartelt1">[26]</a>. The two sequences of 
                  <i>F. verticillioides</i> obtained in this study (CDFA 862 and 863) most closely matched sequences isolated
                  from an adult flies in the family Bibionidae (NRRL 25087)

               <p>
                  <i>Fusarium solani</i> was isolated from all larvae and pupae, but was not isolated from guts of any adult
                  beetles (CDFA875, 877, 878, 879 and 881). This species exhibits a worldwide distribution
                  and, in addition to being a common soil inhabitant, is pathogenic on many host plants
                  including beans, citrus, squash and peppers 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Leslie1">[22]</a>. This species also accounts for most (∼50%) of the 
                  <i>Fusarium</i> infections in humans 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Galimberti1">[24]</a>,

               <p>In addition to 
                  <i>Fusarium proliferatum</i>, another 
                  <i>Fusarium</i> species was directly isolated from mycelia on palm tissue (CDFA874). Blast sequence
                  comparison demonstrated a 94% similarity to isolates of 
                  <i>F. concolor</i> Reinking (NRRL 01847 and NRRL 13459) previously deposited in FUSARIUM-ID database.
                  The relatively low similarity of this isolate to other known species suggests it may
                  prove to be a novel species. However, since it was only cultured from palm tissue,
                  it doesn’t appear to be an important food source for 
                  <i>Brachypeplus glaber</i> individuals in this study.
               </p>
               <p>Two other filamentous, non-
                  <i>Fusarium</i> fungi were also cultured in this study. 
                  <i>Cladosporium cladosporioides</i> (Fresen.) G.A. de Vries was isolated from adult beetle guts that fed from the live
                  cut palm pieces (CDFA891), while 
                  <i>Penicillium</i> species were isolated from guts of all larvae (CDFA909, 916 and 915). Species of
                  
                  <i>Cladosporium</i> Link and 
                  <i>Penicillium</i> are some of the most common and cosmopolitan fungi worldwide.

               <p>The yeast 
                  <i>Meyerozyma caribbica</i> (Vaughan-Mart., Kurtzman, S.A. Mey. &amp; E.B. O’Neill) Kurtzman &amp; M. Suzuki (anmorph = 
                  <i>Candida fermentati</i>), was isolated from pupae, larvae and adult beetles from live palm samples. 
                  <i>Meyerozyma caribbica</i> is commonly encountered in both natural and clinical environments [28; Vaughn-Martini
                  et al. 2005 29, 30]. 
                  <i>Meyerozyma caribbica</i>, and the closely related species 
                  <i>M. guillermondii</i> (Wick.) Kurtzman &amp; M. Suzuki, are believed to form endosymbiotic relationships with
                  many insect species. 
                  <i>Meyerozyma caribbica</i> has been cultured from the guts of nitidulid and scarabaeid beetles 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Suh1">[31]</a>, as well as the fungal combs of fungus growing termites 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Guedegbe1">[32]</a>. This species may play an ecological role in xylose fermentation of wood-ingesting
                  beetles as many isolates have been shown to be high xylitol producers 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Suh1">[31]</a>, 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-SreenivasRao1">[33]</a>. Both are considered antagonistic yeasts, and have been used as biological control
                  agents for postharvest fungal fruit decays

                  associated biological data are from the flower stalks of 
                  <i>S. palmetto</i>. The presence of 
                  <i>B. glaber</i> in the subcortical habitat of the pine tree was either an accidental occurrence,
                  misidentification, or was indicative of a refuge for the beetle that provided shelter
                  a food source, or both. The authors were unable to locate Hamilton’s specimens to
                  corroborate the identification, and thus misidentification may also be possible.

               <p>The other rare occurrences of 
                  <i>B. glaber</i> away from 
                  <i>S. palmetto</i>, e.g. in flight intercept traps, are likely the result of dispersal activities of
                  the adults to other suitable 
                  <i>S. palmetto</i> hosts that are in flower, and may be accounted for as incidental collections. Furthermore,
                  no immature stages of this beetle have been collected outside the confines of sheaves
                  of mature inflorescence stalks of this palm species. Therefore, we suggest that although
                  these beetles are not known to ingest host plant material, they may require the specific
                  microhabitat established by the inflorescence stalks of 
                  <i>S. palmetto</i> to complete their life cycle (i.e. development of immature stages). Recent collections
                  of 
                  <i>B. glaber</i> in Florida further support that the host plant may not be the sole prerequisite for
                  successful development. These recent 
                  <i>B. glaber</i> collections have been in association with the presence of a diaspidid scale, 
                  <i>Comstockiella sabalis</i> (Comstock). 
                  <i>Comstockiella sabalis</i>, or palmetto scale, is present in the southern United States along the Gulf Coast
                  to Mexico, and is also present in parts of the Caribbean, effectively encompassing
                  the same distribution as 
                  <i>S. palmetto</i> and 
                  <i>S. mexicana</i> Mart.; however it is not necessarily host specific to these two species 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Miller1">[39]</a>. The life cycle of this scale is complex, and often is associated with the presence
                  of a fungus 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Miller1">[39]</a>; unfortunately the identity of this fungus remains unknown. One of the many peculiarities
                  of this scale insect is that it does not incorporate the shed skins into its scale
                  cover and often they are discarded. This latter phenomenon may be important for 
                  <i>B. glaber</i>, which was observed feeding on the discarded shed exuvial remnants. These shed skins
                  likely provide the beetle not only with a source of proteinaceous matter, but may
                  also be the site for fungal and/or yeast development within the inflorescence microhabitat.
                  These shed skins are essentially a meshwork of chitin, wax, and other organic matter
                  that would effectively retain moisture and thus provide a suitable substrate for fungal/yeast
                  development within the confines of the inflorescence stalk. Thus, consuming the shed
                  skins may provide the beetle not only with a source of additional dietary protein,
                  but may also be a key component for ingestion of their gut flora.
               </p>
               <p>In the 1960s, 
                  <i>B. glaber</i> was reared under laboratory conditions by Dr. Dale Habeck at the University of Florida.
                  Habeck placed numerous adults on small pieces of sabal palm flower stalks in 1 oz.
                  plastic cups. Each cup contained about 0.25 inch of Shorey and Hale media 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Shorey1">[40]</a> to provide moisture. The adults were subsequently moved to new containers daily to
                  obtain life history data. From Dale’s extensive notes we provide the following life
                  table information for 
                  <i>B. glaber</i>. Average length of entire life cycle (n = 45) from egg to adult was 35 days (range = 26–45
                  days). In two observed hatchings, the duration of the egg stage was four days, which
                  is similar to that of other known Nitidulidae 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Jelnek1">[3]</a>. The average larval development from egg to pupa (n = 8) took an average of 27.9
                  days (range 21–36 days). Like most other Nitidulidae, members of 
                  <i>Brachypeplus</i> likely pass through three larval instars 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Jelnek1">[3]</a>. The average pupal developmental phase (n = 27) lasted an average of 7.9 days (range
                  4–13 days). This rather rapid pupation process is typical of most multivoltine sap
                  beetle species 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Jelnek1">[3]</a>, and 
                  <i>B. glaber</i> does exhibit multiple generations per year. Rapid pupation in a quickly decaying
                  substrate that is already filled with varied fungal components may be advantageous
                  for successful survivorship by avoiding becoming food for fungi. This particular strategy
                  would enable the individual to remain protected in an enclosed, albeit decomposing,
                  refugium until the mobile adult phase.
               </p>
               <p>Eggs are laid singly or in small groups (up to five observed) in the green areas of
                  the inflorescence stalks that are just beginning to mold. Small, presumably first
                  instar, larvae are often found in the same area as the eggs. Larger, presumably second
                  and third instar, larvae and pupae are found only in the moldier, decaying areas of
                  the inflorescence stalk. When inflorescence stalks first appear, only adults are found
                  and no immature stages. As the stalks develop and become larger and older, with the
                  tips of the sheaths beginning to turn brown, eggs and small larvae begin to appear.
                  As the stalks gradually senesce, becoming progressively more infested with molds,
                  mature larvae and pupae can be found. Adults are found year round in the Gainesville
                  area, and only adults are known to overwinter in this area. Collection label data
                  support this phenomenon in general throughout the species range (see 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295.s001">Appendix S1</a>).
               </p>
               <p>Gut content analyses (see 
                  <a href="#pone-0089295-t001">Table 1</a>) suggest that adults are primarily feeding on species of 
                  <i>Fusarium</i> (specifically 
                  <i>F. oxysporum</i> E.F. Sm. &amp; Swingle and 
                  <i>F. verticilliodes</i> (Sacc.) Nirenberg) and 
                  <i>Cladosporium cladosporioides</i>. In contrast, larval gut contents and behavioral studies revealed a preference for
                  different 
                  <i>Fusarium</i> species [i.e. group 1 of 
                  <i>F. proliferatum</i> (Matsush.) Nirenberg ex Gerlach &amp; Nirenberg, 
                  <i>F. solani</i>, and 
                  <i>F</i>. sp. 1] as well as 
                  <i>Penicillium</i> species. Very few fungal components were found to be similar between the guts of
                  adults and larvae, however, all life stages (except the egg, which was not analyzed)
                  were found to contain the yeast 
                  <i>M. caribbica</i>.

            <p>The observed associations of the beetle, scale insect, plant, fungi, and yeast of
               this system yield more questions than answers. Clear roles for each of the constituents
               of the system remain somewhat obscured. However, the following is what we have observed,
               know, or presently suspect. With few exceptions, the beetles have been found only
               in sheaths of sabal palm flower stalks which are also occupied by a scale insect.
               Based on Dale Habeck’s previous notes, in conjunction with our own collecting and
               observations presented here, 
               <i>B. glaber</i> apparently occurs only within the confined spaces of sabal palm flower stalks. Additional
               palm species have been sampled, but not extensively. However, considering the amount
               of effort spent by other researchers collecting on palm and palm flowers, it is obvious
               that these beetles can be easily overlooked and are found only if the collectors are
               looking in the appropriate niche.
            </p>
            <p>We attempted to rear additional 
               <i>B. glaber</i> specimens for deposition in museums. Palm stalks were cut into small sections and
               placed in a 0.5 m
               <sup>2</sup> cardboard box. This box was then sealed with tape and a glass emergence jar placed
               in a hole on the side. Emergence chambers such as this are used to collect insects
               as they emerge from hosts and try to escape by moving to the light visible through
               the glass jar. After several months with no 
               <i>B. glaber</i> present in the emergence jar, the rearing effort was considered a failure and the
               box was broken down for disposal. At that time, several hundred dead adults were found
               in the layers of the box and stuck to the tape. This phenomenon emphasizes that beetles
               like 
               <i>B. glaber</i> can be present in large numbers within a niche, and rarely if ever collected in nearby
               situations even on the same structure. Without thorough sampling of a suspected niche,
               secretive beetles such as this may be easily overlooked, even by experienced collectors.
               This result also suggests that these beetles exhibit negative phototaxy, which would
               be advantageous for exploiting the confines of inflorescence sheaves.
            </p>
            <p>In support of the observation of a secretive existence, 
               <i>B. glaber</i> has never been collected (to the best of our knowledge) by anyone working with insects
               that pollinate sabal palm flowers. We have thoroughly examined sabal, and other palm
               species flowers looking for weevils, cerambycid beetles, and other interesting insects,
               but no 
               <i>B. glaber</i> have been collected. Simply collecting on flowers is not enough to find 
               <i>B. glaber</i>. The palm stalks must be peeled, layer by layer, looking closely between the sheaths.
               Niche specialization is only one reason 
               <i>B. glaber</i> is rarely encountered. Sabal palms bloom only after they have matured, and in many
               cases these blooms are well out of reach of any collector even when using long-handled
               nets. Thus, the majority of 
               <i>B. glaber</i> populations spend their lives well out of reach of researchers.
            </p>
            <p>The armored scale insect 
               <i>C. sabalis</i> (Diaspididae) is specific to sabal palms, frequently abundant on the host, and commonly
               found with 
               <i>B. glaber</i> in the flower stalks. Being an armored scale, they secrete little or no honey-dew
               and produce very little wax. There is no evidence that 
               <i>B. glaber</i> feeds on living scales, however, they do feed on shed skins. The chemical and nutritional
               profile of the shed skins remains unknown, however further examination of their make-up
               may provide insight into interesting components of the beetle diet and a mechanism
               for obtaining otherwise rarely encountered food sources (i.e. proteins, vitamins,
               and co-vitamins).
            </p>
            <p>The fungi and yeasts isolated from the beetles that grow on the palm surface are known
               to occur in other places and there are likely other fungi and yeasts that could occur
               in sabal palms. Our sampling of fungi and yeasts was from a single locality, and it
               is possible that different fungi or yeasts are used by 
               <i>B. glaber</i> in other localities. Additional sampling is required to confirm our results over
               the beetle’s known range, but is beyond the scope of this paper. However, as noted
               by Suh and Blackwell 
               <a href="#pone.0089295-Suh2">[41]</a>, often there is only one yeast species isolated from a single beetle species regardless
               of range. Thus, the likelihood of the yeast component changing across the range of
               
               <i>B. glaber</i> is minimal. At present, it appears that 
               <i>B. glaber</i> is a niche specialist on sabal palms, where the niche is arboreal flattened cavities
               in living flower stalks that contain certain filamentous fungi and the yeast 
               <i>M. caribbica</i>. Additional sampling and study of other palms in Florida will help solidify the hypotheses
               that 
               <i>B. glaber</i> is restricted to the sabal palm, and may help explain why. Lachance et al. 
               <a href="#pone.0089295-Lachance1">[42]</a> demonstrated that anthophilous sap beetles often transfer specific yeasts as potential
               food substrates and that some biogeographical implications can be traced as a result.
               Their study included 
               <i>Conotelus</i> Erichson, a genus related to 
               <i>Brachypeplus</i> within the subfamily Cillaeinae. Our results indicate that yeasts associated with
               
               <i>Brachypeplus</i> are different from those of 
               <i>Conotelus</i>, and no 
               <i>Conotelus</i> in their study harbored any 
               <i>Meyerozyma</i> species. Further research on yeast associations in sap beetle guts and a robust phylogeny
               of sap beetles, may prove useful in understanding shifts from anthophily to fungivory
               or vice versa (see also scenarios discussed by Kirejtshuk 
               <a href="#pone.0089295-Kirejtshuk1">[43]</a>).
            </p>
            <p>Collection of sap beetles on other fermenting sources indicated that low numbers of
               specimens visit areas with 
               <i>Penicillium</i> present 
               <a href="#pone.0089295-Dorsey1">[7]</a>. However, this study only focused on adult sap beetles, and the presence of 
               <i>Penicillium</i> in all larval guts in our study may indicate that these fungi are preferentially
               used by larvae for development and are not needed by adults. Adult and larval physiology
               are dramatically different in holometabolous insects, and 
               <i>Penicillium</i> may provide developing larvae with the requisite materials needed for successful
               development. Likewise certain species of 
               <i>Fusarium</i> may possess proportionately more essential amino acids, vitamins, sterols, and other
               nutrients that other species of 
               <i>Fusarium</i> do not possess for optimal larval development, or conversely for adult gamete development
               during oogenesis and spermatogenesis. Thus, larvae and adults may be preferentially
               selecting different fungal species based on different dietary and developmental needs.
               These and other physiological requirements may ultimately be the driving force of
               resource partitioning between adults and larvae in 
               <i>B. glaber</i>. The role of the ingested scale insect shed exuviae is unknown but may be providing
               additional nutrients to adults as well.

               <p>Immature forms of Nitidulidae are mostly known from agriculturally important genera
                  such as 
                  <i>Brassicogethes</i> Audisio and Cline, 
                  <i>Carpophilus</i> Stephens, 
                  <i>Stelidota</i> Erichson, and 
                  <i>Glischrochilus</i> Reitter. The remainder of the taxa, which often exhibit cryptic lifestyles, remain
                  little known. Larvae of some species, such as members of 
                  <i>Psilopyga</i> LeConte, occur on ephemeral substrates such as stinkhorn fungi; and many other genera,
                  e.g. 
                  <i>Cyllodes</i> Erichson, 
                  <i>Pallodes</i> Erichson, and 
                  <i>Apsectochlius</i> Reitter, occur on relatively ephemeral Agaricales mushrooms. Others, i.e. 
                  <i>Thalycra</i> Erichson, feed on hypogean Hymenogastrales fungi such as 
                  <i>Rhizopogon</i> Fr. Others such as 
                  <i>Xenostrongylus</i> Wollaston are leaf miners as larvae. However, many larvae, like 
                  <i>Brachypeplus</i>, occur in subcortical conditions completely obscured from view where they likely
                  persist on wood decaying fungi and yeasts. As noted in Cline et al. 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Cline3">[14]</a>, the rearing and molecular methods used for associating life stages of 
                  <i>B. glaber</i> not only provide a 100% reliable means for discerning this species, but establishes
                  a protocol for other sap beetle workers, and beetle workers in general, to begin determining
                  and describing immature stages.

               <p>The biomedical aspects of this research show potential for bio-prospecting within
                  the southeastern United States. There appear to be antifungal properties of the pupal
                  stages of 
                  <i>B. glaber</i>, and these properties may extend to larval and adult stages as well (though not tested
                  here). Our results indicated that 
                  <i>Fusarium</i>, 
                  <i>Cladosporium</i> and 
                  <i>Penicillium</i> were all negatively affected an antifungal compound associated with the pupal stage,
                  as evidenced by a distinct zone of inhibition extending several millimeters outward
                  from the pupal body in all directions. No fruiting bodies or hyphae from any of the
                  fungi penetrated the zone of inhibition. The affected fungi are representatives of
                  three disparately related fungal lineages, and all are of medical importance as they
                  are known to cause a variety of infections, particularly in immune-compromised patients
                  
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Galimberti1">[24]</a>. For example, two of the 
                  <i>Fusarium</i> species we found (
                  <i>F. solani</i> and 
                  <i>F. verticillioides</i>) are responsible for 70% of 
                  <i>Fusarium</i> infections 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Galimberti1">[24]</a> and are notoriously resistant to current antifungal drugs 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Jain1">[27]</a>. Secondly, the 
                  <i>Cladosporium</i> species we found (
                  <i>C. cladosporioides</i>) was recently found to cause skin lesions in humans 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Sang1">[44]</a>. Though most 
                  <i>Penicillium</i> species do not infect humans, 
                  <i>P. marneffei</i> Segretain causes penicilliosis, particularly in immune-compromised individuals 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Galimberti1">[24]</a>. Both 
                  <i>Cladosporium</i> and 
                  <i>Penicillium</i> species are commonly found in homes as ‘black-mold’ and their spores are thought
                  to be a significant contributor to the development of asthma in children 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Aira1">[45]</a>, 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Meng1">[46]</a>. Development of the broad spectrum antifungal compound(s) present in 
                  <i>B. glaber</i> could provide a new method of treatment, and may open up avenues of research into
                  a potential new family of antifungal chemicals.
               </p>
               <p>At this time it is unclear whether the antifungal compound(s) are secreted by the
                  pupa or an associated microorganism. The yeasts associated with the beetles may play
                  a role in the fungal suppression we observed, as may bacteria (though none were observed).
                  The yeast 
                  <i>Meyerozyma caribbica</i> seems the most likely candidate as the related 
                  <i>Meyerozyma guilliermondii</i> has been shown to significantly reduce the amount of infection by the post-harvest
                  green and blue mold citrus pathogens, 
                  <i>Penicillium digitatum</i> (Pers.) Sacc. and 
                  <i>P. italicum</i> Stoll respectively 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Arras1">[34]</a>, 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Arras2">[35]</a>. Likewise, it has also shown to have antifungal properties against gray mold of strawberries
                  caused by 
                  <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> Pers. 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Wisniewski1">[36]</a>, 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Wszelaki1">[37]</a>. In both instances, cells of 
                  <i>M. guillermondii</i> were shown to directly attach to hyphae of the plant pathogen and, in the case of
                  gray mold, to secrete cell wall degrading enzymes against the pathogen 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Arras2">[35]</a>, 
                  <a href="#pone.0089295-Wisniewski1">[36]</a>. Various bacteria are also known to provide antifungal and antimicrobial defenses
                  when living symbiotically with insects [47, 48; 49; 50; 51; Kaltenpoth 2009). Though
                  no colonies of bacteria were observed in our study, this possibility should be explored
                  further.

               <p>Sabal palms are easily grown in cultivated situations as ornamental plants in urban
                  landscapes, therefore nursery microhabitats for mass-rearing 
                  <i>B. glaber</i> are well known. Likewise, rearing 
                  <i>B. glaber</i> on a combination of artificial diet and palm cuttings has already been demonstrated
                  by Habeck in the 1960s, and was detailed herein. Therefore, rearing 
                  <i>B. glaber</i> in laboratory situations is possible; however acquisition of yeast or other anti-fungal
                  agent may not be possible if beetles are solely reared on artificial diets. The methods
                  above also clarify the culturing and DNA sequencing of the fungal and yeast components,
                  which provide reliable identification of these fungi. We are currently applying these
                  methods to develop a protocol for extracting and isolating the antifungal secretion
                  from the immature stages of the beetle. Once the compound is isolated, simple trials
                  against pure cultures of known fungal pathogens will ensue to determine the compound’s
                  efficacy. These results will be discussed in an upcoming paper.

            <p>An understanding of the natural history of insects and their kin may indeed provide
               great advances in our understanding of the micro and nanobiological realms. Although
               the small size scale of insects, fungi, and yeast have previously deterred investigations
               into their biology, the ever-increasing sensitivity of molecular methods now allow
               for greater and more complex studies of these organisms. Trips to remote rainforests
               may not be necessary to identify, characterize, and mass produce biomedical compounds
               for human use. However, an intimate knowledge of the biology of the target organism
               is the requisite first step to achieving the discovery of natural products from any
               ecosystem. We hope this research leads to other fruitful discoveries from insect-plant-fungal
               interactions and/or the interesting life history biology of insects in our own backyard.

            <p>Dale Habeck, one of the academic mentors of author PES, worked on the life history
               of 
               <i>Brachypeplus glaber</i> in the 1960s–1970s and produced rough drafts of a manuscript during that time. Dale
               died in 2009 leaving many specimens and this long-term project unpublished. The unfinished
               rough draft manuscript and some original line drawings were graciously supplied by
               Dr. J. Miller and Dr. D. Matthews, MGLC. We hope this manuscript provides a satisfactory
               end to that work, and perhaps inspires others to more deeply explore 
               <i>Brachypeplus</i> and/or the interesting life history biologies of insects in their own backyards.
