Caffeine is an alkaloid that can be toxic to insects and is hypothesized to act as a defence mechanism to inhibit herbivory. Here we show that caffeine is degraded in the gut of <italic>H. hampei</italic>, and that experimental inactivation of the gut microbiota eliminates this activity. We demonstrate that gut microbiota in <italic>H. hampei</italic> specimens from seven major coffee-producing countries and laboratory-reared colonies share a core of microorganisms. Globally ubiquitous members of the gut microbiota, including prominent <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species, subsist on caffeine as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen. <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> caffeine demethylase genes are expressed <italic>in vivo</italic> in the gut of <italic>H. hampei</italic>, and re-inoculation of antibiotic-treated insects with an isolated <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strain reinstates caffeine-degradation ability confirming their key role.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms8618-i1.jpg"/>The coffee berry borer, the main insect pest of coffee, feeds and lives on the caffeine-rich beans despite caffeine's toxic effects.

Female coffee berry borers are minute bark beetles (<italic>ca.</italic> 2&#x02009;mm long) that bore a hole in the coffee berry and build galleries within the coffee seed, where they deposit their eggs. Larvae feed on the seed, causing significant losses both in quality and yields. Yearly losses in Brazil alone have been estimated at $285&#x02013;315 million (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), making the insect the most devastating pest of coffee worldwide. This cryptic life cycle inside the berry makes insect control problematic. The devastating socioeconomic consequences of <italic>H. hampei's</italic> worldwide invasion have stimulated ample research on possible pest management methods; however, detailed information on some basic aspects of the insect's biology, such as metabolism, is scarce. Acu&#x000f1;a <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> demonstrated that the natural acquisition and integration of a mannanase gene of bacterial origin into the <italic>H. hampei</italic> genome has enabled the insect to exploit the primary carbohydrate reserve found in coffee beans. Moreover, previous work<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> reported no correlation between caffeine concentrations (range: 2&#x02013;17&#x02009;mg&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) in the beans of 12 <italic>Coffea</italic> species and resistance to <italic>H. hampei</italic>, suggesting that the insect possesses mechanisms to degrade or efficiently excrete caffeine, which permits it to withstand its toxic effects, and significantly reduce crop yield.</p><p>In insects as in other animals caffeine degradation can be catalysed by cytochrome P450 enzymes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. However, no other metazoans have been reported to endure the concentrations of caffeine to which <italic>H. hampei</italic> is exposed while simultaneously subsisting and completing its full life cycle exclusively on green coffee beans. We hypothesized that caffeine degradation in <italic>H. hampei</italic> is primarily mediated by the activity of its gut microbiota. Here we present the first study of the microbiome of <italic>H. hampei</italic> and its role in the detoxification of caffeine in the insect. Our discovery of a microbiota component to the transformation of caffeine and subsistence of <italic>H. hampei</italic> on coffee beans has important implications for understanding the metabolism and ecology of this major pest.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Caffeine degradation in <italic>H. hampei</italic></title><p>To test the hypothesis that caffeine degradation is a microbially mediated process in <italic>H. hampei</italic>, we obtained specimens from seven geographically dispersed coffee-producing regions: Kenya (Kiambu), Indonesia (East Java), India (Karnataka), Puerto Rico (Adjuntas), Hawaii (Kona), Guatemala (Coatepeque) and Mexico (Chiapas). Specimens from India also included insects sampled from both dominant <italic>Coffea</italic> species (<italic>C. arabica</italic> and <italic>C. canephora</italic>). In addition, we used a laboratory-reared colony originally derived from a Colombian <italic>H. hampei</italic> population and three other bark beetle species incapable of subsisting on coffee beans (<italic>H. crudiae</italic>, <italic>H. eruditus</italic> and <italic>Scolytodes maurus</italic>).</p><p>First, we tested for caffeine degradation following passage through the insect gut and determined whether the gut microbiota were responsible for this process. This hypothesis was tested with the use of a <italic>H. hampei</italic> laboratory-reared colony in a controlled experiment using an artificial diet (here referred to as minimal diet), containing green <italic>C. arabica</italic> coffee beans with a final caffeine concentration of &#x0223c;1.8&#x02013;2.2&#x02009;mg&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. <italic>Hypothenemus hampei</italic> specimens were introduced to vials containing this defined diet and displayed typical boring activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>) and production of frass. The quantity of diet consumed and the residence time of diet in the <italic>H. hampei</italic> digestive tract were determined by incorporating fluorescent sphere tracers in the diet. Residence time was typically 3&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) and corresponded to a mass of &#x0223c;14&#x02009;&#x003bc;g of diet or 25&#x02009;ng of caffeine. To quantify caffeine concentrations in the low masses of produced frass, we used Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) calibrated with pure caffeine standards<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Measurements of caffeine concentration by FTIR were further validated using gas chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry (GC&#x02013;MS; Methods and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). After passage of diet through the <italic>H. hampei</italic> digestive tract, caffeine was no longer detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). To determine involvement of the microbiota in caffeine detoxification, we eliminated microorganisms using the defined diet supplemented with three broad-spectrum antibiotics (tetracycline, rifampicin and streptomycin). Laboratory insects were reared on this antibiotic-supplemented diet for 4 weeks, which eliminated culturable microorganisms, before being transferred to fresh antibiotic-free diet and were allowed to feed for 4&#x02009;h. Antibiotic-treated insects exhibited no decrease in caffeine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), with concentrations in their frass being similar to that of the diet. This was strongly suggestive of a role of the gut microbiota in caffeine removal. Elimination of the gut microbiota also had a significant impact on <italic>H. hampei</italic> fitness with approximately a 95&#x00025; decline in eggs and larvae relative to control insects, and no progression to pupa or adult stage over the 44-day experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Biogeography analysis of <italic>H. hampei</italic>'s microbiome</title><p>To identify members of the <italic>H. hampei</italic> gut microbiota that may contribute to caffeine degradation, we analysed the bacterial composition of <italic>H. hampei</italic> microbial communities using 16S rRNA gene sequencing from specimens of major coffee-producing regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Phylogenetic &#x003b2;-diversity and hierarchical clustering showed the separation of microbiomes by geographic origin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Nonparametric permutational multivariate analysis of variance was used to partition variance in microbiome composition among the key factors. Geographic location explained much of the variance (45&#x00025;) in bacterial composition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). In locations where the coffee species varied (India; <italic>C. arabica</italic> and <italic>C. canephora</italic>), coffee species accounted for 78&#x00025; of the variance in microbial composition. Although the dominant microbial taxa also varied geographically, network analysis showed a core of organisms detected across all locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). These organisms were affiliated with the orders Pseudomonadales, Enterobacteriales, Turicibacteriales, Rhizobiales, Alteromonadales, Actinomycetales among others; with the Pseudomonadales being highly abundant in all collected specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Caffeine-degrading bacteria in the gut of <italic>H. hampei</italic></title><p>To determine whether the identified microorganisms in the biogeography analysis were involved in caffeine detoxification in <italic>H. hampei</italic>, we isolated bacteria that were capable of subsisting on caffeine as a sole carbon and nitrogen source using the digestive tracts of insects collected in Mexico and Hawaii as inocula.

While surviving in this environment, <italic>H. hampei</italic> experiences chronic exposure to caffeine which is known to be a toxic alkaloid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, making this insect an attractive model system in which to evaluate the role of microbes in the adaptation of animals to unusual environments. In this study, we tested whether caffeine degradation in <italic>H. hampei</italic> is mediated by the insect's gut microbiota.</p><p>To test for the contribution of <italic>H. hampei</italic>'s gut-associated microbes to caffeine degradation, first feeding rates and transit time of the fed-diet through the insect's gut were determined. Once the parameters for the transit time of the diet were obtained, a set of insects was fed on minimal diet supplemented with antibiotics to deplete its microbiota. Frass samples were collected from <italic>H. hampei</italic> specimens feeding on minimal diet and diet supplemented with antibiotics and their caffeine content compared using FTIR and GC&#x02013;MS. These results demonstrated that insects with an intact microbiome had a nearly complete degradation of the caffeine during its transit through the beetle gut. However, contrary to the control insects, antibiotic treated <italic>H. hampei</italic> specimens lost the ability to degrade caffeine, demonstrating the importance of the insect's microbiome to this critical function. Depletion of the microbiome also had a pronounced impact on the insect's reproductive fitness. Across all developmental stages observed, antibiotic treatment resulted in significant and substantial declines in numbers of viable insects relative to controls. While the mechanism underlying this observation is likely complex and not addressed here, it has been observed previously that members of other insect microbiomes can be responsible for the regulation of behaviour, feeding habits, mating preferences, reproductive capacity and the acquisition or the production of nutrients required by the host<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.</p><p>Members of the gut microbiota of <italic>H. hampei</italic> were identified from insects collected from seven coffee-producing countries and a laboratory colony. The calculated &#x003b2;-diversity and variance partitioning analyses demonstrated that the composition of the <italic>H. hampei</italic> microbiome was significantly associated with geographic origin of the coffee and also with the species of coffee where that varied (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). The formation of morphocryptic units was previously demonstrated in <italic>H. hampei</italic> samples collected from different coffee-producing countries by the analysis of microsatellite markers and COI gene sequences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. These reported &#x02018;species complexes', together with our findings of a geographic variation of microbial communities in <italic>H. hampei</italic>, may be indicative of the co-evolution of insects and their microbiota. Caffeine content varies significantly between the coffee species assessed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> and, although not tested here, caffeine concentration may be another important factor having an impact on <italic>H. hampei</italic> gut microbiome composition.</p><p>Despite the observed variation in microbiome composition demonstrated by the biogeography analysis, all insect specimens shared a common core of microorganisms as demonstrated by network analysis. The shared microbial groups included the Pseudomonadales, Enterobacteriales, Turicibacteriales, Rhizobiales, Alteromonadales and Actinomycetales. Fourteen caffeine-subsisting bacteria from the orders of the Pseudomonadales, Rhizobiales, Enterobacteriales and Actinomycetales were isolated from the guts of field specimens of <italic>H. hampei</italic> on media containing caffeine as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen. It is significant that many of the <italic>H. hampei</italic> microbiome common core were also confirmed to subsist <italic>in vitro</italic> on caffeine. To evaluate the possible mechanisms of caffeine degradation, all isolates were screened for the gene <italic>ndmA</italic> that codes for a monooxygenase that participates in the initial demethylation of caffeine in bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Only <italic>P. fulva</italic> isolates yielded positive amplification. Given that the Pseudomonadales were also the dominant group detected in the <italic>H. hampei</italic> gut microbiome across all sampled locations, we determined whether this pathway was active in field specimens of <italic>H. hampei</italic> actively infecting coffee beans. Total RNA from these field specimens was analysed using quantitative PCR with reverse transcription for transcripts of the <italic>ndmA</italic> gene and positive amplification demonstrated its expression <italic>in situ</italic>, providing further evidence of the possible contribution of <italic>P. fulva</italic> to caffeine degradation in the insect. Because the monooxygenase encoded by the <italic>ndmA</italic> gene is an enzyme that requires oxygen to function, oxygen availability in the gut of <italic>H. hampei</italic> was also characterized with the use of microelectrodes. As in the case of other insects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, the gut of <italic>H. hampei</italic> contains a radial oxygen gradient that changes slowly from microaerophilic to anaerobic conditions. The existence of this gradient suggests that the gut of this insect can provide the environment for the occurrence of aerobic processes such as the transformation of caffeine by the NdmA demethylase, and also anaerobic processes that are likely important such as the fermentation of the sugars from the coffee bean.</p><p>To confirm the role of <italic>P. fulva</italic> in the degradation of caffeine <italic>in vivo</italic>, antibiotic-treated laboratory specimens were reinfected with <italic>P. fulva</italic>. Insects were subsequently fed with sterile minimal diet and their frass collected for caffeine quantification. This demonstrated that re-inoculation with <italic>P. fulva</italic> reinstated the ability of <italic>H. hampei</italic> to degrade caffeine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), confirming the importance of this member of the gut microbiota in the caffeine-detoxification process. To test whether <italic>P. fulva</italic> alone could aid <italic>H. hampei</italic> in the recovery of its reproductive fitness, a third set of insects treated with antibiotic was inoculated with <italic>P. fulva</italic> and used for the fitness assessment. However, insects did not recover their ability to reproduce after inoculation. A process as complex as reproduction may require a proper nutritional state of the insect that relies in part on the metabolic activity of its associated microbes or may require the presence of other bacterial endosymbionts known to influence reproductive health<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Determining the minimal set of microorganisms to reinstate reproductive fitness as well as comparison of the effect of coffee species with varying caffeine concentrations on the microbial communities associated with <italic>H. hampei</italic> are important topics for further research.</p><p>Here we demonstrate that <italic>H. hampei</italic>, the most devastating coffee pest in coffee-producing countries, possesses a common core of gut microbiota that is shared among individuals from different geographic locations, and that many of these organisms can subsist on caffeine as their sole source of carbon and nitrogen.

A mixture of internal retention index markers was prepared using fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) of C8, C9, C10, C12, C14, C16, C18, C20, C22, C24, C26, C28 and C30 linear chain length, dissolved in chloroform at a concentration of 0.8&#x02009;mg&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (C8&#x02013;C16) and 0.4&#x02009;mg&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (C18&#x02013;C30). The FAME mixture (20&#x02009;&#x003bc;l) was added to 1&#x02009;ml of N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide containing 1&#x00025; of Trimethylclorosilane. Ninety microlitres of N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide spiked with the FAME mixture was then added to each extract followed by mixing for 30&#x02009;min at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Pure caffeine (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to generate a calibration curve with levels at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in 50&#x00025; methanol. One hundred microlitres of each level was dried and derivatized using the same procedure described for the samples. Derivatized samples were manipulated using a Gerstel automatic liner exchange MPS system (Gerstel, Muehlheim, Germany) controlled with the Maestro software v.1.4.25.8 to inject 2&#x02009;&#x003bc;l of sample into a Gerstel CIS cooled injection system. The injector was operated in the splitless mode, and the split vent was opened after 25&#x02009;s. Samples were injected into the inlet initially at 60&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, which was then ramped to 270&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in 12&#x02009;&#x000b0;C&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> increments and held for 3&#x02009;min. Sample separation was carried out on a 30-m-long, 0.25-mm ID Rtx-5Sil MS column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA), 0.25&#x02009;mm 5&#x00025; diphenyl film with a 10-m integrated guard column using an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), controlled with the Agilent GC&#x02013;MS MassHunter Acquisition software v.B07.00 SP1 with a constant flow rate of 1&#x02009;ml&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Initial oven temperature was 60&#x02009;&#x000b0;C with the following gradient applied: held at 60&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 1&#x02009;min; ramp at 10&#x02009;&#x000b0;C&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to 310&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, held for 10&#x02009;min. Mass spectrometry was performed with an Agilent 5977 single quadrupole MS with 250&#x02009;&#x000b0;C transfer line temperature, electron ionization at 70&#x02009;eV, an ion source temperature of 230&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and a quadrupole temperature of 150&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Mass spectra were acquired in a selected ion-monitoring mode at a scan rate of 4.4 spectra&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Selected ions for caffeine were 55, 82, 109 and 194. A quality-control mix was run in triplicate before and after the sample set to confirm GC and MS signal reproducibility. Caffeine levels were quantitated in acquired data using Agilent MassHunter Quantitative Analysis v.B.07.00.</p><p>For FTIR and GC&#x02013;MS analyses, significant differences between treatments (control, antibiotic-treated and antibiotic-treated/re-inoculated) were determined using one-way analysis of variance and least significant differences using the R software environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Antibiotic treatment effect on <italic>H. hampei</italic> reproduction</title><p>One hundred females recently emerged as adults were placed together with 20 males in vials containing regular diet and were incubated for 14 days to maximize mating. After the initial mating incubation, individual females were transferred to a vial containing either regular diet (control) or diet supplemented with antibiotics (as described above) and incubated for 44 days. A third set of mated females was treated with antibiotics for 3 weeks, transferred to diet with <italic>P. fulva</italic> and also incubated for 44 days. Fifteen vials from each treatment were destructively sampled on each sampling time (days 14, 24, 34 and 44) and screened for eggs, larvae, pupae and adults. A logistic regression was performed on the sum of all stages in each vial. Then, a model was fit with just the main effects (DIET&#x02014;control, antibiotics, infection; and SAMPLE&#x02014;sampling time), where overdispersion was included. Both main effects were significant, that is, there is a significant effect of DIET when compared with control, and there is a significant effect of sample (later samples had higher counts).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional information</title><p><bold>Accession codes:</bold> 16S rRNA sequences from the biogeography analysis have been deposited in the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) database with the accession code PRJEB8706.
