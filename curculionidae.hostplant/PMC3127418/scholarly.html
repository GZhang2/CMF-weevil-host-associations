               <p>Fuller's rose weevil, 
                  <i>Naupactus cervinus</i> (Boheman) (Curculionidae: Entiminae), is an important quarantine pest of New Zealand
                  kiwifruit exported to Asian markets. Both adults and larvae are considered to be polyphagous.
                  In this study, the survival of larval 
                  <i>N. cervinus</i> was estimated on common groundcover species of kiwifruit (
                  <i>Actinidia</i> spp.) in the Bay of Plenty, the main region in New Zealand where kiwifruit is grown.
                  The botanical composition of groundcover in commercial kiwifruit orchards, characterised
                  by survey, was dominated by ryegrass (
                  <i>Lolium perenne</i>), with white clover (
                  <i>Trifolium repens</i>), creeping buttercup (
                  <i>Ranunculus repens</i>), wild strawberry (
                  <i>Duchesnea indica</i>) and broadleaf dock (
                  <i>Rumex obtusifolius</i>) in lower abundance. Survival to mature larvae or adult was relatively low (·11%)
                  for 
                  <i>N. cervinus</i> introduced as neonates to field plots or potted ryegrass, white clover and broadleaf
                  dock. White clover was a more favourable host for survival to adults than ryegrass.
                  This study suggests that increased survival of 
                  <i>N. cervinus</i> larvae may occur where white clover and large dock plants are abundant, but that
                  survival is likely to be highly variable because of the heterogeneous availability
                  of preferred host plants and host plant quality. These data suggest that larval polyphagy
                  is a strategy that enables 
                  <i>N. cervinus</i> to persist at low densities in kiwifruit orchards despite variation in the quality
                  and diversity of groundcover.

               <i>Naupactus cervinus</i> (Boheman) (Curculionidae: Entiminae), is a flightless weevil from Argentina that
               has become cosmopolitan in distribution (
               <a href="#bibr09">Chadwick 1965a</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr01">AlonsoZarazaga and Lyal 1999</a>). It has a mixed taxonomic history with many junior synonyms including 
               <i>Pantomorus cervinus</i> (Boheman), 
               <i>P. godmanni</i> Crotch, 
               <i>Asynonychus cervinus</i> Crotch, 
               <i>A. godmanni</i> Crotch and 
               <i>Aramigus julleri</i> Horn (
               <a href="#bibr10">Chadwick 1965b</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr01">Alonso-Zarazaga and Lyal 1999</a>). The accepted common name in the USA is Fuller rose beetle (
               <a href="#bibr04">Bosik 1997</a>); in New Zealand and Australia, it is known as Fuller's rose weevil (
               <a href="#bibr37">Penman 1984</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr08">Carne 1987</a>). Larvae of 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> are regarded as a minor pest of citrus in Australia, Brazil, and Florida because
               of root herbivory (
               <a href="#bibr17">Hely 1948</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr44">Tarrant and McCoy 1989</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr23">Lanteri et al. 2002</a>). In New Zealand kiwifruit, root herbivory by larvae and leaf herbivory by adults
               are not regarded as problems. However, eggs laid on fruit are, or have been, a quarantine
               barrier for New Zealand exports of kiwifruit to Japan, South Korea and some smaller
               markets (
               <a href="#bibr43">Steven 2005</a>). Eggs on fruit have also been a quarantine barrier for exports of citrus from California
               and Australia to markets in East Asia (
               <a href="#bibr21">Lakin and Morse 1989</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr25">Madge et al. 1992</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr02">Anon. 2004</a>).
            </p>
            <p>In Argentina, both males and females occur but populations established elsewhere consist
               only of females that reproduce by parthenogenesis (
               <a href="#bibr22">Lanteri and Normark 1995</a>). In Australia, New Zealand and California, 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> has a one-year life-cycle with adults emerging from pupation sites in soil between
               mid summer and early autumn (
               <a href="#bibr17">Hely 1948</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr34">May 1979</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr35">Morse et al. 1988</a>). Adults are flightless and their dispersal may largely be due to human agency. Longevity
               is typically 3–6 months during which between 100 and 1000 eggs are laid in batches
               of about 20–30 eggs. Longer-lived weevils lay most eggs (
               <a href="#bibr09">Chadwick 1965a</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr30">Masaki et al. 1996</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr29">Masaki and Kadoi 1997</a>). Crevices in a wide variety of artificial and natural substrates are used as oviposition
               sites. Newly-hatched larvae burrow into soil and feed externally on roots until development
               is complete some 6–9 months later (
               <a href="#bibr29">Masaki and Kadoi 1997</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr31">Masaki and Nakahara 2000</a>).
            </p>
            <p>Both adult and larval 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> are polyphagous, having been recorded feeding on a wide variety of cultivated plants
               and weeds (
               <a href="#bibr09">Chadwick 1965a</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr29">Masaki and Kadoi 1997</a>). Not all hosts are likely to be equally preferred or of equal value for growth and
               survival. Polyphagous insects tend to have a hierarchy of preference (e.g. 
               <a href="#bibr11">Firempong and Zalucki 1990</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr46">Thompson 1998</a>), and sometimes have a narrower host range at the individual level than at the species
               level because of intrinsic genetic diversity and heterogeneous availability and quality
               of hosts (
               <a href="#bibr18">Howard et al. 1994</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr48">Walter 2003</a>). In New Zealand, Maher and Logan (
               <a href="#bibr27">2004</a>) found that adults of 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> preferred to feed on the orchard groundcover plants white clover (
               <i>Trifolium repens</i>) and broadleaf dock (
               <i>Rumex obtusifolius</i>) rather than kiwifruit (
               <i>Actinidia deliciosa</i>) and citrus. Further, when given a choice of ryegrass (
               <i>Lolium perenne</i>) and white clover, adult 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> aggregated strongly in the latter (Logan and Maher, unpublished observations). The
               host plant has a strong influence on adult longevity and fecundity (
               <a href="#bibr29">Masaki and Kadoi 1997</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr27">Maher and Logan 2004</a>) and as a result, host plant availability is likely to be important in the population
               dynamics of 
               <i>N. cervinus</i>. Host preference and performance of larvae on different hosts is less well studied
               than for adults. Masaki and Takahashi (
               <a href="#bibr32">1999</a>) reared larvae of 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> in the laboratory on potatoes in soil, and on potted strawberry and citrus. Survival
               after 90 days at 24°C was relatively high:64% on strawberry, 66% on citrus and 92%
               on potato. There were significant differences in body weight after 90 days, with only
               16% of larvae reared on strawberry becoming fully-grown compared with all larvae reared
               on potato. Survival of larvae in the field, including in New Zealand kiwifruit orchards,
               has not been measured. Here the survival of larval 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> was estimated on common groundcover species of kiwifruit grown in the Bay of Plenty,
               the main region of kiwifruit production in New Zealand. While roots of kiwifruit vines
               may also support 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> larvae, we focussed on groundcover because it is potentially more amenable to manipulation.
               The botanical composition of groundcover in kiwifruit orchards was also characterised
               by survey. These data provide a basis for understanding the population dynamics of
               
               <i>N. cervinus</i> in New Zealand kiwifruit orchards.

               <p>To estimate survival of 
                  <i>N. cervinus</i> in groundcover, plots (0.5 × 0.5 m square) were established between two kiwifruit
                  blocks at the HortResearch kiwifruit orchard at Te Puke, Bay of Plenty. The sides
                  of each plot were enclosed by black polythene sheeting to a depth of 200 mm. Plots
                  had a mixed groundcover of grasses (
                  <i>Lolium perenne</i>, 
                  <i>Poa annua</i>, 
                  <i>Holcus mollis</i>, 
                  <i>Digitaria sanguinalis</i>), white clover (
                  <i>Trifolium repens</i>), and some broadleaf weeds (
                  <i>Cerastium glomeratum</i>, 
                  <i>Rumex obtusifolius</i>, 
                  <i>Veronica persica</i>). Newly hatched larvae (n = 150) of 
                  <i>N. cervinus</i> were added to the surface of 36 plots during the autumn (22–26 April) of 2002. Based
                  on limited data from commercial kiwifruit orchards, this density of larvae may be
                  ten times higher than is typical and was selected to increase the chance of recovery.
                  Larvae were from eggs laid by a colony of at least 200 adults collected from five
                  geographically separated commercial kiwifruit orchards. Adults were fed on citrus
                  leaves and laid eggs in folds of waxpaper or plastic sheets, and were assumed to be
                  typical of 
                  <i>N. cervinus</i> in the Bay of Plenty. This is likely to be a fair assumption as, in New Zealand,
                  
                  <i>N. cervinus</i> reproduce parthenogenetically and are relatively genetically uniform (
                  <a href="#bibr28">Mander et al. 2003</a>). Soil in six plots was excavated to a depth of 150 mm on 8 July (days 73–77 after
                  larval introduction), 14 October (days 175–179), 13 November (days 201–205), 16 December
                  (days 234–238), and 3 February (days 283–287). Larvae and pupae of 
                  <i>N. cervinus</i> were extracted from soil by wet-sieving and flotation in magnesium sulphate solution
                  using a method similar to Kain and Atkinson (
                  <a href="#bibr19">1976</a>). Subsamples of larvae were confirmed as 
                  <i>N. cervinus</i> based on the following combination of taxonomic characters: a mainly colourless head
                  that is retracted into the prothorax, a length of no more than 10 mm, and with postdorsal
                  seta I twice as long as postdorsal seta II on abdominal segments II–IV (
                  <a href="#bibr33">May 1977</a>). Number of larvae and pupae, and dry weight of roots were recorded for three depths
                  of soil, 0–50 mm, 50–100 mm and 100–150 mm for each sample. Dry root mass was determined
                  after drying roots retrieved during wet-sieving, at 60°C for 96 h. Cages made of wood
                  and screen mesh (1 mm aperture) in the form of a pyramid with catch container at the
                  apex, were placed over each plot on 15 November 2002 and checked weekly to remove
                  emerged adults until 22 April 2003.
               </p>
               <p>Data for numbers of larvae recovered were analysed with a binomial Generalized Linear
                  Model. The number of days since introduction of larvae (Days) was considered an ordered
                  factor to see if Days had an effect on the proportion of larvae found at the various
                  levels. The model assumed the conditions affecting survival of larvae were identical
                  for each plot and that the number of larvae burrowing deeper than 150 mm could be
                  ignored, either because it was zero, or if not zero, was a similar proportion in all
                  plots. Natural mortality after days 175–179 was assumed to be negligible also, as
                  was the number reaching maturity. Equality of larval numbers found at each depth was
                  tested by comparison with the χ2 distribution. The number of larvae recovered at each
                  depth was compared with root mass at the same depth by correlation.

               <p>Three experiments were undertaken to determine whether initial larval density affected
                  survival to mature larva or adult stage. In experiment 1, dock (
                  <i>R. obtusifolius</i>) plants were dug from the groundcover of the HortResearch kiwifruit orchard at Te
                  Puke, washed to remove soil and invertebrates, and established in 5-L pots with screened
                  Te Puke sandy-loam soil. Different numbers (10, 40, 70, 100) of newly hatched larvae
                  were added to each of 10 pots on 24 May 2002. In experiment 2, newly hatched larvae
                  were added to 32 pots at either 10 (16 pots) or 100 larvae (16 pots) per pot on 7
                  August 2002. All pots had been filled with screened Te Puke sandyloam soil and sown
                  with a commercial lawn seed mix (80% 
                  <i>L perenne</i>, 20% 
                  <i>T. repens</i> and 
                  <i>Festuca</i> spp.). After inoculation with larvae, all pots in experiments 1 and 2 were kept on
                  a bench in a glasshouse. Fine mesh covers were added to the top of all pots in experiments
                  1 and 2 in December 2002 and emerged adults were collected once each week between
                  23 January and 11 April 2003, after which no further adults were found. In experiment
                  3, newly hatched larvae were added to 36 pots on 4–8 July 2003. Pots had been filled
                  with screened soil and planted with a one-year-old dock plant grown from seed, Endophyte-free
                  ryegrass (
                  <i>L. perenne</i>) or white clover (
                  <i>T. repens</i> ‘Kopu II’). Sowing rate for the latter two hosts was approximately 50 seeds/pot,
                  which is about five times the commercial rate of 10 kg/ha for ryegrass and 5 kg/ha
                  for white clover. Both white clover and ryegrass were sown approximately two months
                  prior to larval introduction. Half of each group of 36 pots was inoculated with 40
                  and half with 100 larvae per pot so that there were 18 pots for each host × density
                  grouping. Potted plants were grown in a greenhouse and initially watered daily until
                  September when they were moved to weed matting in open air and watered once aweek.
                  Watering was by automatic overhead sprinkler and lasted for 30 minutes. Soil in the
                  pots was hand-sorted in early February 2004 to recover and count numbers of mature
                  larvae and pupae.
               </p>
               <p>After experiments to identify whether initial density of larvae influenced survival,
                  the effect of host plant on survival to full-grown larvae or pupae was tested for
                  white clover, ryegrass and a 50:50 mix of white clover and ryegrass (experiment 4).
                  Air-dried Te Puke sandy-loam was sieved through 1-mm mesh and added to 180 2-L pots;
                  60 pots were planted with ryegrass, white clover or ryegrass + white clover at a rate
                  of approximately 50 seeds per pot. Newly hatched larvae (n = 40 per pot) were introduced
                  to the soil surface of each pot on 21 July 2004 when plants were three months old.
                  Pots were buried in a field plot to ground level so that larvae experienced field
                  temperatures. Six pots of each host plant were removed from soil on September 22–24
                  (63–65 days after larvae were introduced) and November 17–19 (119–121 days), eight
                  plants per host on December 22–23 (154–155 days), and ten plants per host on February
                  4 and 7 (198, 201 days) and surviving larvae counted after wet-sieving (sieve aperture
                  sizes: 212 µm, 1 mm and 2.5 mm) in a solution of magnesium sulphate at 1.05 SG. Cages
                  were added to the top of each remaining pot (30 per host) and any emerged adults were
                  removed weekly between February 1 and May 30. The numbers of larvae surviving under
                  the different circumstances were analysed using the GLM functionality in R (
                  <a href="#bibr38">R Development Core Team 2005</a>). In most cases, the data were highly underdispersed because of a large number of
                  zeros; in some cases it was overdispersed. To allow for the dispersion, the “quasibinomial”
                  GLM family was considered more appropriate than the standard binomial family, which
                  is assumed to have a dispersion parameter of 1.
               </p>
               <p>The head-capsule width of newly hatched larvae (n = 30) and of larvae recovered from
                  pots (n = 30, or all recovered survivors) was measured with the aid of an eyepiece
                  graticule on a dissecting microscope, to track larval growth. Hourly temperature was
                  measured at 10 mm depth in soil adjacent to pots by temperature logger from 29 July
                  2004 until no further adults had emerged in May 2005. Dry weight of root mass recovered
                  after sieving was determined by drying roots in an oven at 80°C for 48 hours. Dry
                  root mass for the three plant hosts (white clover, ryegrass, ryegrass + white clover)
                  and for pots for each of four sampling dates was analysed using an unbalanced two-way
                  ANOVA after transformation by square- root to reduce variance heterogeneity. Plots
                  were examined to ensure that residuals were normally distributed and evenly spread
                  across groups. Significance was at 
                  <i>P</i> &lt;0.05 and analysis was carried out in Genstat 9.1 (

               <p>The groundcover of 100 commercial blocks, 50 each of the two dominant commercial kiwifruit
                  cultivars ‘Hayward’ and ‘Hort16A’, was sampled to determine the most abundant groundcover
                  species. Blocks were distributed throughout the area of kiwifruit production in the
                  western Bay of Plenty, an area approximately 100 km long and extending approximately
                  20 km from the coastline. The composition of the groundcover was determined by basal-hit,
                  single-point sampling (
                  <a href="#bibr36">Owensby 1973</a>) for 50 points within each block between mid February and late March 2004. Most kiwifruit
                  in New Zealand is grown using a pergola support system enabling the groundcover to
                  be sampled under the entire canopy. Each point was located using a list of random
                  numbers for the number of steps between samples. Direction between samples was alternated
                  by 90° in a zig-zag pattern. Roy et al. (
                  <a href="#bibr40">1998</a>) and Taylor (
                  <a href="#bibr45">1980</a>) were used as references for plant identification. Diversity of groundcover for each
                  cultivar was summarised by calculating α of the log series and the Berger-Parker index
                  for each site and comparing these values by two-sample t-test. The log series is a
                  distribution model for species abundance described by the parameter α and the total
                  number of individuals, N (
                  <a href="#bibr26">Magurran 1988</a>). The Berger-Parker index (d) is a measure of species dominance and was calculated
                  as d = N
                  <sub>max</sub>/N where N
                  <sub>max</sub> is the number of the most abundant species (

               <p>Relatively few larvae were recovered on each sampling date and very few adults were
                  found in traps (mean per plot ± sample SD: 2.3 ± 2.3) (
                  <a href="#t01">Table 1</a>). Pupae (mean per plot ± SD: 2.7 ± 2.3) were found in the top soil stratum (0–50
                  mm) of samples on days 283–287. Days after introduction of larvae to field plots had
                  no effect on the number of larvae recovered (
                  <i>P</i> &gt; 0.05 in every measure) or on the proportion of larvae at each of the three soil
                  depths (
                  <i>P</i> &gt; 0.05). From that observation, steady state conditions were assumed to have formed
                  so that the number of larvae found at each depth reflected a preference for that depth.
                  The number of larvae combined for all sampling dates differed at the three depths
                  (χ
                  <sup>2</sup> = 47.5, df = 30, 
                  <i>P</i> = 0.02). More larvae occurred at 0–50 mm deep (n = 181) than at 51–100 mm (n = 52)
                  and 101–150 mm (n = 10). Number of larvae and root mass at each depth were positively
                  correlated for the final three sampling periods (

               <p>In experiments 1 and 2, 
                  <i>N. cervinus</i> completed development from first instar to adult on broadleaf dock and on grass,
                  although survival was low (
                  <a href="#t02">Table 2</a>). There was no effect of density on survival of larvae reared on dock (
                  <i>P</i> &gt; 0.05) (
                  <a href="#t02">Table 2</a>). There was some evidence that an initial high density of larvae (100/pot) affected
                  survival on grass (
                  <i>P</i> = 0.02), although the result must be treated with caution as there were only two
                  pots with surviving adults in the low density treatment (10/pot). The difference may
                  reflect the precision of the measurements more than any difference between the densities.
                  Adults emerged slightly earlier from pots with dock (week of 50% emergence = 7–14
                  February) than from pots with grass (28 February-7 March), reflecting the earlier
                  date of introduction to the former. In experiment 3, density had no significant effect
                  on the number of larvae recovered, nor was there any interaction between density and
                  host (
                  <i>P</i> &gt; 0.05). There was a trend for survival on ryegrass to be lower than for white clover
                  (
                  <i>P</i> ∼ 0.06). Neither could be compared in a reliable way to dock, on which mortality
                  was almost 100% at both densities.
               </p>
               <p>In experiment 4, there was an interaction between the effect of host and the sampling
                  date, so that the differences between the hosts were strongly influenced by the time
                  of year in which they were compared (
                  <a href="#f01">Figure 1a</a>). Consequently, the effect of hosts was calculated separately for each sampling date.
                  No differences were significant for samples on 22–24 September (63–65 days after introduction)
                  (
                  <i>P</i> &gt; 0.05). Numbers of larvae were significantly lower in ryegrass than in clover and
                  ryegrass + clover on 17–19 November (119–121 days) (
                  <i>P</i> = 0.02). For samples taken on 22–23 December (154–155 days), numbers of larvae in
                  clover were not different from those in ryegrass + clover (
                  <i>P</i> &gt; 0.05), but neither could be compared with ryegrass, on which there were no survivors.
                  Similarly, on 4–7 February (198–201 days), numbers of larvae in clover were not different
                  from those in ryegrass + clover (
                  <i>P</i> &gt; 0.05) but neither could be compared with ryegrass, on which there were no survivors.
                  The same number of adults emerged from pots with white clover (mean ± SEM: 0.7 ± 0.2)
                  and ryegrass + clover (0.7 ± 0.2) (
                  <i>P</i> &gt; 0.05). Numbers of survivors from both treatments were different to those from ryegrass
                  (0.03 ± 0.03) (P &lt; 0.03).
               </p>
               <p>Mean dry root mass differed for hosts (F = 53.0; df = 2,79; 
                  <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and sampling date (F = 13.3; df = 3,79; 
                  <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Differences between hosts were influenced by time of the year (F = 2.8;
                  df = 6,79; 
                  <i>P</i> = 0.015) and hosts were compared for each sampling date by Fisher's LSD test at α&lt;
                  0.05. No differences in dry root mass occurred on 22–24 September. Clover root mass
                  differed from the other two hosts on the second sample date, 17–19 November, and all
                  three hosts differed in root mass dry weight for the final two sampling dates in December
                  and February (

               <p>A total of 53 groundcover plant species were identified in the survey of ‘Hayward’
                  and ‘Hort16A’ kiwifruit blocks; 39 species were common to both cultivars. The most
                  common groundcover species for both kiwifruit cultivars and the only species present
                  at all sites was ryegrass (
                  <i>L. perenne</i>) (mean incidence ± sample SD: ‘Hayward’, 29.3 ± 10.8%; ‘Hort16A’, 23.6 ± 9.9%). Bare
                  ground made up 22.0 ± 19.0% and 21.0 ± 14.8% of groundcover of ‘Hayward’ and ‘Hort16A’
                  kiwifruit blocks, respectively. A further 30% of groundcover of both cultivars was
                  made up by white clover, creeping buttercup (
                  <i>Ranunculus repens</i>), wild strawberry (
                  <i>Duchesnea indica</i>) and broadleaf dock, in order of abundance. Groundcover plant diversities as indicated
                  by α of the log series were similar for ‘Hayward’ and ‘Hort16A’ (
                  <i>P</i> &gt; 0.05), but dominance by the most common plant species differed between groundcovers
                  of each cultivar (
                  <i>P</i> = 0.007) (
                  <a href="#f02">Figure 2</a>). Ryegrass was the most abundant groundcover species in 44/50 ‘Hayward’ sites and
                  33/50 ‘Hort16A’ sites.

            <p>Survival to mature larvae or adults for 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> introduced as neonates to field plots and potted groundcover plants was, in general,
               highly positively skewed; some pots or plots had relatively high larval survival but
               many had very low survival or no surviving larvae. This survival pattern implies that
               the density of neonate larvae, in the range tested, may not have a large influence
               on establishment and that other factors were more important. Average survival was
               in the range 4–11%, with two exceptions. Survival of neonates introduced to broadleaf
               dock in experiment 1 was 5–10% as expected, but low in experiment 3 (&lt;1%). Similarly,
               survival to adults or mature larvae on ryegrass or mixed grass was 4–11% in experiments
               2 and 3, but was &lt;1% for experiment 4. Dock plants removed from the field and replanted
               in experiment 1 were mature plants with many large tap roots. In contrast, the dock
               plants used in experiment 3 were smaller with few large tap roots, and hence may have
               provided less opportunity for larval feeding. Grass appeared to be much more uniform
               in pots and differences in survival are difficult to explain. Small plant size for
               docks may have affected weevil survival and led to an unfair comparison with ryegrass
               and white clover in experiment 3. Herbivory by 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> larvae was associated with a reduction in root mass of white clover and ryegrass
               in experiment 4 between spring and early summer. Ryegrass began to recover by mid-summer
               and this probably reflected both the significant decline in numbers of 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> larvae and the warmer temperatures. Root growth of white clover recovered more slowly
               than ryegrass and there is potential for the white clover component of groundcover
               to be reduced by 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> herbivory.

            <p>Ryegrass was the dominant groundcover species and is likely to be a common host plant
               of 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> larvae in kiwifruit orchards in the Bay of Plenty. Although 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> can complete development on ryegrass, white clover may be superior as a host. Despite
               having significantly higher root mass in summer, fewer adults emerged from pots with
               ryegrass than with white clover, either alone or in combination with ryegrass. Similarly,
               Hardwick et al. (
               <a href="#bibr16">1999</a>) found that white clover was preferred to ryegrass by larvae of the closely related
               white-fringed weevil, 
               <i>Naupactus leucoloma</i> (Boheman). Populations of 
               <i>N. leucoloma</i> reached their highest levels in pasture dominated by legumes such as white clover
               (
               <a href="#bibr20">King and East 1978</a>). Legumes are also preferred hosts for other broadnosed (entimine) weevils such as
               
               <i>Hypera postica</i> (Gyllenhal), 
               <i>Sitona lepidus</i> Gyllenhal, and 
               <i>S. discoideus</i> Gyllenhal (
               <a href="#bibr24">Latheef et al. 1979</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr06">Bright 1994</a>). Performance of larval 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> on white clover is consistent with the preferences and increased fecundity of adult
               
               <i>N. cervinus</i> on white clover compared with other potential hosts in New Zealand kiwifruit (
               <a href="#bibr27">Maher and Logan 2004</a>). Clover-dominated groundcover may thus favour population growth by 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> in orchards. In addition to groundcover, 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> may also feed and complete development on kiwifruit roots. Larvae of the closely
               related weevils 
               <i>N. xanthographus</i> (Germar) and 
               <i>N. leucoloma</i>, and the polyphagous garden weevil, 
               <i>Phlyctinus callosus</i> Boheman, are able to complete development on kiwifruit (

               <i>N. Xanthographus</i>, other fruit crops such as citrus are superior hosts to kiwifruit (
               <a href="#bibr39">Ripa 1986</a>). In this study, larvae were predominantly found in the top 100 mm of the soil surface,
               where roots of ground cover plants are most abundant.

            <p>Relatively low larval survival in this study is consistent with the observation of
               low adult densities in kiwifruit orchards in the Bay of Plenty. Commercial kiwifruit
               orchards identified by packhouse operators in the kiwifruit industry as having ‘high’
               populations of 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> had average annual catches in emergence traps of 2–3 adults m (C. McKenna et al.,
               unpublished observations). By comparison, in New Zealand pasture or lucerne crops,
               populations of some other broad-nosed weevils such as 
               <i>S. lepidus</i>, 
               <i>S. discoideus</i> and 
               <i>N. leucoloma</i> can exceed &gt;30 late instar larvae or pupae m
               <sup>-2</sup> (
               <a href="#bibr49">Wightman 1986</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr15">Hardwick and Prestidge 1994</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr07">Brownbridge et al. 2006</a>). Low larval survival in this study contrasts with that of Masaki and Takahashi (
               <a href="#bibr32">1999</a>). They reared 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> on potatoes and on potted strawberry and citrus, and recorded larval survival of
               more than 60% to late instar. Environmental conditions and hosts differed between
               studies. Masaki and Takahashi (
               <a href="#bibr32">1999</a>) reared larvae in the laboratory at 24°C; in this study, larvae were reared under
               field or greenhouse conditions and exposed to more variable and in general cooler
               temperatures. Chadwick (1965) considered that most mortality in 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> occurred as pupae and newly-emerged adults. Mortality in this study occurred mainly
               in the early instars, with numbers of older larvae reaching a near steady state. Factors
               limiting establishment in the field could include failure to find adequate food, very
               dry or wet periods, extremes of temperature, and predation by natural enemies. These
               factors, or a combination of these factors may have been an important larval mortality
               in this study. This is partly implied by relatively high survival (&gt;60% to mature
               larvae) of 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> on potatoes in the laboratory (
               <a href="#bibr32">Masaki and Takahashi 1999</a>) and on artificial diet (30–50% to adults)(G. Clare, HortResearch, Auckland, personal
               communication). Dry soil reduced establishment of black vine weevil larvae, 
               <i>Otiorhynchus sulcatus</i> (Fabricius) (
               <a href="#bibr41">Shanks and Finnigan 1973</a>), but was probably not a factor in this study as soil was kept relatively moist by
               irrigation or rainfall after neonates were introduced. Conversely, poorly drained
               soil may be detrimental to establishment by young larvae; neonate 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> introduced to artificial diet for rearing were trapped and drowned by excessive moisture
               (G. Clare, personal communication). The pest status of 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> on citrus, typically grown commercially on sandy free-draining soils, may indicate
               a preference for relatively dry soil conditions and for soils with a relatively high
               fraction of sand. Soil in pots was a sandy loam that had been dried and sieved to
               reduce poor drainage and its negative impact on larval establishment. Extremes of
               soil temperature were probably not a significant mortality factor, particularly in
               the mild temperate climate of the Bay of Plenty, as neonates of 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> tolerate a wide range of temperatures (
               <a href="#bibr44">Tarrant and McCoy 1989</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr30">Masaki et al. 1996</a>). The latitudinal spread of 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> from Nelson, New Zealand (41°17′S) to Ottawa, Canada (45°22′N) (Chadwick 1965) also
               suggests a wide tolerance to temperature differences. Host-finding behaviour in soil
               typically relies on host volatiles and is probably impeded when soil is compacted
               such as occurs in orchard interrows (e.g. 
               <a href="#bibr47">Vogeler et al. 2006</a>). Soil with bulk densities of 1.1 g cm and a preponderance of small diameter pores
               (0.15 mm) restricted movement by first-instar corn rootworms 
               <i>Diabrotica virgifera virgifera</i> (
               <a href="#bibr13">Gustin and Schumacher 1989</a>). First instar 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> have a similar head-capsule width as first-instar corn rootworm (∼0.2 mm) and may
               be similarly affected by compacted orchard soils. Hamon et al. (
               <a href="#bibr14">1990</a>) suggested that carabids could reduce numbers of larvae of 
               <i>Sitona lineatus</i> (L.) by up to 10% in field beans. No carabids were observed in soil in pots. The
               ants, 
               <i>Pheidole rugulosa</i> and 
               <i>Paratrechina</i> sp. established nests in 10% of pots in experiment 4 and the adventive predatory
               staphylinid 
               <i>Thyreocephalus</i> sp. was also observed in field plots and some pots. The latter may have been responsible
               for some larval mortality; however, the presence of an ant colony was not clearly
               associated with an absence or low number of larvae in pots. Naturally-occurring entomopathogenic
               fungi and nematodes infect and kill the soildwelling larvae and pupae of 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> and other weevil species (
               <a href="#bibr03">Beavers et al. 1983</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr42">Smith et al. 1997</a>). However few cadavers were recovered from pots and no attempt was made to isolate
               pathogens or to rear larvae to identify infections.
            </p>
            <p>The high level of larval mortality is likely to be a key factor governing population
               size in 
               <i>N. cervinus</i>. In New Zealand at least, 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> populations appear to be low in comparison with those of some other entimine pest
               weevils in pasture. According to Bloem et al. (
               <a href="#bibr05">2002</a>), adult 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> may be abundant at particular sites and times of the year in Florida, but they provided
               no data. In citrus-growing areas in southern Australia, weekly counts of 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> in citrus canopies were always less than 10 per tree (
               <a href="#bibr25">Madge et al. 1992</a>), a density probably not significantly higher than found in Bay of Plenty kiwifruit.
               Observations that adult 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> can be abundant in pre-production kiwifruit orchards where mowing is infrequent suggest
               that density of groundcover is important. In general, however, there are inadequate
               population data to draw robust conclusions about favourable environments for 
               <i>N. cervinus.</i> This study suggests that increased survival of 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> larvae may occur where white clover and large dock plants are abundant, but that
               survival is likely to be highly variable because of the heterogeneous availability
               of preferred host plants and host plant quality. We suggest that larval polyphagy
               is a strategy that enables 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> to persist at low densities in kiwifruit orchards despite variation in the quality
               and diversity of groundcover. Further studies of 
               <i>N. cervinus</i> in New Zealand and elsewhere would be valuable in assessing the role of groundcover
               and tree hosts relative to other factors such as climate in determining population
               size.
