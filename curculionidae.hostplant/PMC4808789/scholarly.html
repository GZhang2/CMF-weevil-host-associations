               <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/">Peppers (
                  <i>Capsicum</i> spp.) are an important crop in the USA, with about 32,000 ha cultivated in 2007,
                  which resulted in $588 million in farm revenue. The pepper weevil, 
                  <i>Anthonomus eugenii</i> Cano (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is the most troublesome insect pest of peppers
                  in the southern United States. It is therefore urgent to find different vulnerabilities
                  of pepper cultivars
                  <i>,</i> fruit and plants parts, fruit colors and sizes, and timing to infestation by 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i>. Also relevant is testing whether fruit length and infestation state affect fruit
                  numbers, weights, and proportions of fruit that are infested. Counts of 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i> adults and marks from oviposition and feeding suggested that 
                  <i>C. chinense</i> Jacquin “Habanero” was least susceptible, and 
                  <i>C. annuum</i> L. cultivars “SY” and “SR” were most susceptible
                  <i>.</i> Comparison of plant parts and fruit sizes revealed that 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i> preferred the peduncle, calyx, and top of pepper fruits over the middle, bottom,
                  leaves, or remainder of flowers. 
                  <i>Anthonomus eugenii</i> does not discriminate between green or yellow fruit color nor vary diurnally in numbers.
                  Based on adult counts, medium to extra-large fruits (≥1.5 cm long) attracted more
                  weevils than small fruits (&lt;1.5 cm). However based on proportions of fruit numbers
                  or fruit weights that were infested, there were no differences between large and small
                  fruits. Choice of pepper cultivar can thus be an important part of an IPM cultural
                  control program designed to combat 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i> by reduced susceptibility or by synchronous fruit drop of infested fruits. Our results
                  are potentially helpful in developing scouting programs including paying particular
                  attention to the preferred locations of adults and their sites of feeding and oviposition
                  on the fruit. The results also suggested the potential value of spraying when the
                  fruits are still immature to prevent and control infestation.

            <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/">Two production classes of peppers (
               <i>Capsicum</i> spp.; Solanales: Solanaceae) are produced commercially in the USA: Bell (mild) and
               Chili (spicy) [
               <a href="#B1-insects-07-00009">1</a>]. In 2007, total pepper production in the USA was about 22,000 ha of Bell and 10,000
               ha of Chili peppers with production values of $468 million and $120 million, respectively
               [
               <a href="#B1-insects-07-00009">1</a>]. The pepper weevil, 
               <i>Anthonomus eugenii</i> Cano (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is the most problematic insect pest of peppers
               in the southern United States [
               <a href="#B2-insects-07-00009">2</a>]. Although native to Mexico, 
               <i>A.</i>
               <i>eugenii</i> is found throughout most of Central America, the Caribbean, and the southern USA
               from California to Florida, where it became established in 1935 [

               <a href="#B4-insects-07-00009">4</a>]. According to Speranza 
               <i>et al.</i> [
               <a href="#B5-insects-07-00009">5</a>] it also has become established in southern Europe. Because of pepper production
               outside these areas and international shipments, it also may be found in other pepper-growing
               regions, such as in Australia, Africa, and Asia.

            <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/">One generation is completed in 20 to 30 days, but 3 to 5 generations are produced
               annually [
               <a href="#B2-insects-07-00009">2</a>,
               <a href="#B3-insects-07-00009">3</a>]. The female makes an egg cavity with her mouthparts, deposits a single egg beneath
               the bud or fruit surface, then covers the cavity containing the egg with a light brown
               fluid that hardens and darkens [
               <a href="#B2-insects-07-00009">2</a>,
               <a href="#B6-insects-07-00009">6</a>]. A female oviposits 5–7 eggs per day with a mean fecundity of 341 eggs per lifetime
               [

               <a href="#B7-insects-07-00009">7</a>]. The egg stage (4.3 days) is followed by the first (1.7 days), second (2.2 days),
               and third (8.4 days) instars, then the pupa (4.7 days), followed by the adult stage,
               hence, the duration from egg to adult emergence is 21.3 days [
               <a href="#B2-insects-07-00009">2</a>,
               <a href="#B3-insects-07-00009">3</a>]. Sizes of 
               <i>A. eugenii</i> include the egg (0.5 mm long); three instars (1 mm, 1.9 mm, and 3.3 mm, respectively);
               pupa (~3 mm); and adult (2.0–3.5 mm) [
               <a href="#B2-insects-07-00009">2</a>]. Pupation occurs within a flower or fruit, and upon eclosure from the pupa, the
               adult escapes from the fruit by making a round exit hole [
               <a href="#B2-insects-07-00009">2</a>]. These data on fecundity, stage duration, and size were based on some of the earliest
               studies [
               <a href="#B3-insects-07-00009">3</a>,
               <a href="#B7-insects-07-00009">7</a>], which did not specify the temperature or humidity. However, Toapanta 
               <i>et al.</i> [
               <a href="#B6-insects-07-00009">6</a>] found that maximum 
               <i>A. eugenii</i> fecundity (3.1 eggs/female/days), shortest development time (12.9 days), and minimal
               mortality were obtained at 30 °C, the temperature for maximum population increase.

            <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/">To initially find food plants, insects use cues varying from general to host-specific,
               such as volatiles, then short-range, olfactory, mechanical, and gustatory cues help
               to verify the suitability of the plant for feeding or oviposition [
               <a href="#B8-insects-07-00009">8</a>,
               <a href="#B9-insects-07-00009">9</a>]. 
               <i>Anthonomus eugenii</i> larvae develop only on plants in the Solanaceae, and females oviposit only on 
               <i>Capsicum</i> and 
               <i>Solanum</i>, though adults also feed on 
               <i>Physalis</i>, 
               <i>Lycopersicon</i>,

               <a href="#B10-insects-07-00009">10</a>]. Addesso and McAuslane [
               <a href="#B9-insects-07-00009">9</a>] found that 
               <i>A. eugenii</i> females oviposited on all 
               <i>Capsicum</i> spp., but only on some 
               <i>Solanum</i> spp., for example, not on tomatoes. Among vegetables, 
               <i>A. eugenii</i> is most problematic on its namesake and attacks all pepper cultivars (
               <i>Capsicum</i> spp.). However tomatillo, 
               <i>Physalis philadelphica</i> Lam., is also moderately susceptible, and eggplants 
               <i>Solanum melongena</i> L. grown near peppers are occasionally infested [
               <a href="#B2-insects-07-00009">2</a>]. Among weeds, several species of nightshades support 
               <i>A. eugenii</i>, including the common black nightshade 
               <i>Solanum americanum</i> Mill. [
               <a href="#B2-insects-07-00009">2</a>,

               <a href="#B11-insects-07-00009">11</a>]. These and other nightshade species grow along perimeters of fields previously planted
               with peppers, and they often serve as alternate hosts when peppers are absent [
               <a href="#B11-insects-07-00009">11</a>,
               <a href="#B12-insects-07-00009">12</a>]. Hence, nightshade weeds should be destroyed before planting the next pepper crop
               to help prevent infestation.
            </p>
            <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/">Pepper plants may become infested before flowering, though oviposition begins only
               after the plants produce buds and flowers [
               <a href="#B13-insects-07-00009">13</a>]. Plants may become defoliated and fruit production prevented with 30–40 weevils
               per plant; in severe cases, 70%–90% of the flowers and buds may be infested [
               <a href="#B13-insects-07-00009">13</a>,
               <a href="#B14-insects-07-00009">14</a>]. When suitable pepper fruit are absent, 
               <i>A. eugenii</i> may consume stamens and pollen to complete its life cycle [
               <a href="#B13-insects-07-00009">13</a>], and the larvae may complete their development within fallen fruits that do not
               desiccate. Genung and Ozaki [
               <a href="#B15-insects-07-00009">15</a>] found that all the fallen fruits they examined were infested with 
               <i>A. eugenii</i>. Primary damage is caused by larval feeding on seeds and other parts within fruits,
               which become contaminated with frass, insect parts, and decaying plant tissue often
               rendering the core brown and moldy [

               <i>et al.</i> [
               <a href="#B17-insects-07-00009">17</a>] noted a direct relationship between the extent of 
               <i>A. eugenii</i> damage and the amount of internal mold caused by 
               <i>Alternaria alternata</i> (Fr.) Keissler. Secondary fruit damage occurs because of adult feeding and oviposition,
               which also allows the entry of pathogens [
               <a href="#B2-insects-07-00009">2</a>,

               <a href="#B16-insects-07-00009">16</a>]. Puncture marks from feeding adults appear as dark specks on the fruits, which are
               not very damaging, but the fruits are sometimes deformed [
               <a href="#B2-insects-07-00009">2</a>]. Both adult and larval feeding destroy and cause premature abscission of flower
               buds, flowers, and immature fruit [

               <a href="#B19-insects-07-00009">19</a>]. On infested fruits, the peduncle turns yellow and the fruit itself turns yellow
               or red prematurely [
               <a href="#B2-insects-07-00009">2</a>]. Fruit drop is very common and may be the most obvious sign of infestation.

               <i>Anthonomus eugenii</i> is difficult to control with insecticides once populations are established in the
               field because the eggs are deposited within flower buds and fruits where larvae and
               pupae are inaccessible to insecticides or natural enemies [
               <a href="#B19-insects-07-00009">19</a>,

               <a href="#B21-insects-07-00009">21</a>]. Scouting is recommended to plan and commence pest management programs and to allow
               for timing of pesticide applications. Adult population estimates are best obtained
               by visual examination or by yellow sticky traps [
               <a href="#B22-insects-07-00009">22</a>]. According to Andrews 
               <i>et al.</i> [
               <a href="#B23-insects-07-00009">23</a>], an economic threshold recommended when visually scouting for 
               <i>A. eugenii</i> is one adult per 100 plants. Action thresholds of one adult per 400 terminal buds
               [
               <a href="#B21-insects-07-00009">21</a>] or 1% of buds infested also have been suggested [

               <a href="#B24-insects-07-00009">24</a>]. However, one 375-cm
               <sup>2</sup> trap captures as many 
               <i>A. eugenii</i> adults as are detected by inspecting 50 buds [

               <i>et al.</i> [
               <a href="#B4-insects-07-00009">4</a>] found that production of pepper fruit began about 40 days after transplanting, and
               the fruit reached mean sizes above 35 g about 68 days after transplanting. 
               <i>Anthonomus eugenii</i> can infest fruit from flowering until the fruit reaches about 35 g [
               <a href="#B26-insects-07-00009">26</a>]. Hence, there was about a 30-d window of susceptibility to 
               <i>A. eugenii</i> oviposition on fruits. Insecticides such as Actara
               <sup>®</sup> (Thiamethoxam, Syngenta Co., Auckland, New Zealand) [

               <i>A. eugenii</i> [
               <a href="#B11-insects-07-00009">11</a>]. However, disadvantages to insecticide use include the expense and toxicity to humans,
               wildlife, biocontrol agents, and the development of insecticide resistance. Berdegue
               
               <i>et al.</i> [
               <a href="#B4-insects-07-00009">4</a>] investigated the availability of fruit within pepper lines (synchronous 
               <i>versus</i> non-synchronous fruit production) and compared resistant and susceptible lines. They
               found that the fruit availability more strongly affected 
               <i>A. eugenii</i> infestation levels than differences in preferences among pepper lines. Hence, synchronous,
               high pepper production levels and abscission of infested fruits may help to reduce
               the time available for 
               <i>A. eugenii</i> to infest fruit, permit the removal of dropped fruit, and reduce sorting costs at
               harvest [
               <a href="#B4-insects-07-00009">4</a>]. These horticultural practices could allow for more cost-effective control of

               <i>A. eugenii</i>, host plant resistance is an important component of an integrated pest management
               program and has proven to be effective in managing agricultural pests [
               <a href="#B29-insects-07-00009">29</a>]. Berdegue 
               <i>et al.</i> [
               <a href="#B4-insects-07-00009">4</a>] compared 12 commercial pepper cultivars and 23 virus-resistant lines and found that
               
               <i>A. eugenii</i> adults did not exhibit preferences within or between cultivars or lines suggesting
               no differences in resistance or susceptibilities. However, because peppers have shown
               resistance to other insect pests, differences in resistance may exist among other
               pepper lines not yet tested. In the present study, the first hypothesis was that differences
               in cultivars, fruit and plant parts, fruit colors and sizes, and timing cause differential
               susceptibilities of peppers to 
               <i>A. eugenii</i>. The second hypothesis was that fruit length and infestation state significantly

                  one or more replications depending on the test and data collected. The cages were
                  rectangular (91 cm × 58 cm area) with the tops of the shorter sides slanting so that
                  the longer sides were 62 cm and 36 cm high on the rear and front, respectively. The
                  cages had wooden frames, glass tops, and 26%–38% of the area of the two longer sides
                  was covered with cloth for ventilation. Each cage contained 2 fruits for each of the
                  8 cultivars, hence 16 total fruits that were 7-to-9-days old. All fruits were suspended
                  from the opposing shorter sidewalls using four 1-m-long strings; 18 cm separated the
                  centers of four fruits per string from each other and from each sidewall. Strings
                  were elevated about 30 cm above the cage floor, and 12 cm separated adjacent strings
                  from each other and from the longer sidewalls. Four 1.5 cm × 6 cm glass vials were
                  added per cage, one at each corner, and each contained 10% sugar solution with a cotton
                  wick in the center, which was soaked with vial contents to provide additional nourishment
                  for 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i> adults. After being gathered from the laboratory colony, 100 to 150 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i> adults (0–24 h old) were released at the center of each cage. The experimental period
                  for Tests 1–4 collectively spanned 11 days from 26 March to 5 April: Test 1 was 10
                  days (26 March to 4 April); Test 2, 3 days (2–4 April); Test 3, 1 day (5 April); and
                  Test 4, 1 day (3 April). Five factors were compared in the analyses: plant parts (mainly
                  fruit), fruit sizes, fruit colors, pepper cultivars, and times of observation. When
                  one factor was compared, data from the other factors were usually pooled to form extra
                  replications. For example, when comparing the five plant parts for each of the eight
                  cultivars, the number of adult weevils found at each of 14 observation times served
                  as a replication (

                     parts (Test 1a–c) and sum of parts for each cultivar (Test 1d). Individual parts included
                     the peduncle, calyx, and the top, middle, and bottom thirds of fruit. For individual
                     parts, a 3-way factorial (8 cultivars × 5 plant parts × 14 observation times) was
                     initially performed to determine if there were interactions between any of the factors
                     and to find their effects on resulting numbers of adult

                     with 8 cultivars, 5 plant parts, and 14 observation times (replications) (Test 1a);
                     cultivar × observation time with 8 cultivars, 14 observation times, and 5 plant parts

                     observation times, and 8 cultivars (replications) (Test 1c). For the sum of plant
                     parts (Test 1d), two one-way ANOVAs were initially performed including one with 8

                  state (infested or non-infested), and the quantity, length, weight, and resulting
                  size class of fruits. A fruit was considered infested if it had the characteristic
                  exit holes of adult 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i> and/or a yellow calyx. The following fruit lengths were used to determine the size
                  classes for “Milta” (Test 6a): small (0–2.0 cm), medium (2.1–4.0 cm), and large (≥4.1
                  cm). “Hungarian” (Tests 6b,c) fruit sizes were small (0–4.0 cm), medium (4.1–6.0 cm),
                  and large (≥6.1 cm). “Cubanelle” (Test 6d) fruits were small (0–6.0 cm), medium (6.1–10.0
                  cm), or large (≥10.1 cm). There were 9 bags (9 replications) for Test 6a, 8 replications
                  each for Tests 6b and 6c, and 4 replications for Test 6d. Within each of the four
                  data sets (Tests 6a–d), a one-way ANOVA was used to compare the 3 treatments (size
                  classes of fruit).

               <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/">The two initial field tests during the first year involved counting numbers of 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i> larvae within fruit of four pepper cultivars. More larvae were found per Bell pepper
                  fruit than per fruit of “Hungarian wax”, which suggested that adults were more attracted
                  to Bell peppers. However, the apparently larger cross-sectional fruit area (length
                  × width) of Bell than “Hungarian wax” (80 
                  <i>vs.</i> 30 cm
                  <sup>2</sup>) suggests that Bell may have lured more weevils by having larger fruit. “Habanero”
                  had the fewest larvae and thus appeared to be least preferred in one of two tests,
                  though it had the smallest cross-sectional fruit area numerically. The initial test
                  in the second year found that plant parts from “SY” and “SR” generally attracted larger
                  numbers of adult 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i> than parts from the other six cultivars. Two additional comparisons of cultivars
                  with observation times pooled yielded similar results: “SY” and “SR” attracted the
                  most adults and “Jalapeño” and “Habanero” the fewest. When considering cultivars within
                  individual plant parts or with plant parts summed, similar results were found based
                  on varying numbers of marks from adult oviposition and puncture. With exception of
                  the middle and bottom thirds of fruit, “SY” had among the highest numbers of puncture
                  marks per plant part and “Habanero” had among the fewest. One of the two tests (two
                  analyses) for varietal preference from the first year and two tests (four analyses)
                  from the second year provided similar results: “SY” was usually most preferred numerically
                  and “Habanero” least preferred with statistical differences between them in 11 of
                  13 final ANOVAs that included both cultivars. Thus, our field and laboratory experiments
                  showed that 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i> preferred certain cultivars over others with “SY” and “SR” most preferred and “Habanero”
                  least preferred. Seal and Bondari [
                  <a href="#B13-insects-07-00009">13</a>] found that “Hot Cherry” and “Habanero” each had consistently lower infestation levels
                  than nine other cultivars including “Jalapeño”, which was moderately resistant. Our
                  results also suggest that “Habanero” has a relatively low susceptibility or possibly
                  high repellence or antifedence to 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i> infestation. “Habanero” may therefore produce higher yields using less pesticides
                  and hence serve as a potentially good choice for management by varietal resistance.
                  “Habanero” is a cultivar of 
                  <i>C. chinense,</i> which was apparently more resistant (or less susceptible) than 
                  <i>C. annuum</i> to 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i> in the present study. The other seven test cultivars were derived from 
                  <i>C. annuum.</i> Although fruit-size differences among the varieties were not compared statistically,
                  “SY” fruit areas were about 20 cm
                  <sup>2</sup> (4th highest of 8 varieties), “SR” was 2nd highest (72 cm
                  <sup>2</sup>), and “Habanero” was third lowest (15 cm
                  <sup>2</sup>). In addition, the limited number of larvae (usually 1–2) found per infested fruit,
                  which generally appear able support many more larvae, suggests that a marking pheromone
                  limits the number of oviposition events and eggs laid per fruit. Larger fruits may
                  allow for more eggs than small fruits because of the greater distances between sites
                  of adult feeding and oviposition, which may be marked with the pheromone. Hence, smaller
                  fruits may tend to have fewer adults, puncture marks, and oviposition plugs than larger
                  fruits, and fruit size differences may have affected our results. Nonetheless, Seal
                  and Bondari [
                  <a href="#B13-insects-07-00009">13</a>] concluded that some cultivars have a stronger natural resistance to 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i> than others, and plant breeders may be able to enhance the resistance.
               </p>
               <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/">In addition, some pepper lines have fruit production that is more synchronous and
                  concentrated than others. They readily shed fruit infested with 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i>, which helps to reduce the damage compared with lines that shed fewer fruits [
                  <a href="#B4-insects-07-00009">4</a>]. Lines with synchronous, concentrated fruit production had a reduced period of susceptibility
                  to attack by 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i> [
                  <a href="#B4-insects-07-00009">4</a>]. In addition to reducing pesticide use because of fewer 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i> per pepper plant, employing less-susceptible pepper cultivars may enhance the effectiveness
                  of removing dropped, infested fruits as a cultural technique [
                  <a href="#B4-insects-07-00009">4</a>]. Choosing pepper cultivars for greater resistance, tolerance, or reduced susceptibility
                  to 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i>, in addition to synchronous, concentrated fruit production, can therefore serve as
                  effective cultural components of an IPM program.

               <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/">Based on counts of 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i> adults, similar results were found when comparing parts within cultivars (from a
                  factorial with interaction) and when comparing parts with observation times pooled
                  (from a factorial with no-interaction). More adults were generally attracted to the
                  calyx, peduncle, or top third of pepper fruit than to the middle or bottom. Based
                  on numbers of puncture marks and oviposition plugs per plant part from most cultivars
                  with variation, the calyx and peduncle each were preferred over the top, middle, or
                  bottom thirds of fruit. In a third test, no-interaction factorial results for color
                  × part and part × observation time were identical because only plant-part differences
                  were significant and either colors or observation times were pooled. Here, peduncles
                  and top thirds of fruit yielded higher numbers of 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i> than calyxes, middle, or bottom thirds with the top third most preferred and bottom
                  third least preferred. The fourth test yielded four factorial analyses with no-interaction
                  results: one analysis was for 21 plant parts that were compared individually and the
                  other three were for 7, 6, or 4 plant parts or fruit sizes with some or all the plant
                  parts grouped. Medium, large, and extra-large fruit were preferred over small fruit,
                  flowers, and leaves. The top thirds of fruits generally were most preferred with the
                  leaves least preferred. Overall, among the four tests comparing plant parts and/or
                  fruit sizes, 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i> seemed to prefer the top, peduncle, and calyx over the middle and bottom of pepper
                  fruits. Similarly, Toapanta 
                  <i>et al.</i> [
                  <a href="#B6-insects-07-00009">6</a>] found that regardless of temperature (15–33 °C), 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i> produced more feeding punctures on the fruit top than on the middle or bottom, and
                  females deposited more eggs on the top and on or near the calyx than on the middle
                  or bottom. Of the eggs oviposited on pepper fruit, 63%–78% were at the top, 14%–25%
                  at the middle, and 4%–18% at the bottom, but unlike in our findings, 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i> preferred smaller over larger fruit sizes [
                  <a href="#B6-insects-07-00009">6</a>]. The peduncle and calyx are initially formed as part of the flower and thus precede
                  the top, middle, and bottom of pepper fruits in development. Thus, control measures
                  may be most effective when plants are flowering and fruits are immature, which is
                  when applied insecticides may be the most preventative.

                  <i>versus</i> yellow fruit colors were examined in one test with two factorial analyses resulting
                  in no-interaction (color × part and color × observation time), and each found no difference
                  between colors. Observation time was examined in three tests with eight no-interaction
                  analyses. In one test, none of the four analyses with 21, 7, 6, or 4 plant parts yielded
                  differences among numbers of adults that were counted 2 h apart from 6 AM to 8 PM.
                  The other two tests with observation times also found no differences. Apparently,
                  
                  <i>A. eugenii</i> does not discriminate between green or yellow fruit colors nor vary diurnally in
                  its numbers. It occurs or makes oviposition and puncture marks on fruit equally at
                  different observation times and on different fruit colors.
               </p>
               <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/">Across four field tests and three pepper cultivars for fruit characteristics, total
                  numbers and weights of fruit were each highest for large and lowest for small fruit.
                  “Hungarian” was the only cultivar differing among infested fruit numbers or sizes
                  with higher numbers and weights of infested fruits generally found in large than in
                  small fruits. This is similar to total fruit results, which found greater fruit numbers
                  and weights in large than in small fruit not only for “Hungarian”, but also the other
                  two cultivars. More importantly, among size classes within each cultivar, there were
                  no differences in proportions of fruit numbers or of fruit weights that were infested.
                  Seal and Bondari [
                  <a href="#B13-insects-07-00009">13</a>] similarly found that mean numbers of fruits infested with 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i> showed a significant positive correlation with numbers of fruit per plant. These
                  differences suggest that similar proportions of different sizes of “Milta”, “Hungarian”,
                  and “Cubanelle” fruit were infested by 
                  <i>A. eugenii.</i> According to Seal and Bondari [
                  <a href="#B13-insects-07-00009">13</a>], it infests similar proportions of different fruit numbers per plant as well. Hence,
                  there appears to be no advantage in noting fruit-size differences when scouting to
                  help locate 
                  <i>A. eugenii</i> adults.

            <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/">Overall, 
               <i>Capsicum chinense</i> “Habanero” was least susceptible, and 
               <i>C. annuum</i> “SY” and “SR” were most susceptible to attack by 
               <i>A. eugenii</i> based on counts of adults and marks from oviposition and feeding
               <i>.</i> However, “SY” and “SR” fruits tend to be numerically larger than “Habanero” and this
               may have affected the results. 
               <i>Anthonomus eugenii</i> preferred the peduncle, calyx, and top of pepper fruits over the middle, bottom,
               leaves, or remainder of the flowers. There was no discrimination by 
               <i>A. eugenii</i> between green or yellow fruit colors nor diurnal variation in its numbers. Based
               on adult counts, medium to extra-large fruits (≥1.5 cm long) were preferred over small
               fruits (&lt;1.5 cm). However, based on fruit inspection, no differences were found between
               large and small fruits in proportions of fruit numbers or of fruit weights that were
               infested. Choice of pepper cultivar, preferred locations of adults, and their sites
               of feeding and oviposition on fruits may therefore be important in IPM programs which
               combat 
               <i>A. eugenii</i> by reduced susceptibility, synchronous drop of infested fruits, or scouting. These
               results and suggested control measures may help in developing scouting programs and
               may best serve when fruits are small and applied insecticides may be preventative.
