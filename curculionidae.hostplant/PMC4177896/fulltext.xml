However, information on endophyte colonization of onions, and their impacts on the biology of thrips feeding on them, is lacking. We tested the colonization of onion plants by selected fungal endophyte isolates using two inoculation methods. The effects of inoculated endophytes on <italic>T. tabaci</italic> infesting onion were also examined. Seven fungal endophytes used in our study were able to colonize onion plants either by the seed or seedling inoculation methods. Seed inoculation resulted in 1.47 times higher mean percentage post-inoculation recovery of all the endophytes tested as compared to seedling inoculation. Fewer thrips were observed on plants inoculated with <italic>Clonostachys rosea</italic> ICIPE 707, <italic>Trichoderma asperellum</italic> M2RT4, <italic>Trichoderma atroviride</italic> ICIPE 710, <italic>Trichoderma harzianum</italic> 709, <italic>Hypocrea lixii</italic> F3ST1 and <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp. ICIPE 712 isolates as compared to those inoculated with <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp. ICIPE 717 and the control treatments. Onion plants colonized by <italic>C. rosea</italic> ICIPE 707, <italic>T. asperellum</italic> M2RT4, <italic>T. atroviride</italic> ICIPE 710 and <italic>H. lixii</italic> F3ST1 had significantly lower feeding punctures as compared to the other treatments. Among the isolates tested, the lowest numbers of eggs were laid by <italic>T. tabaci</italic> on <italic>H. lixii</italic> F3ST1 and <italic>C. rosea</italic> ICIPE 707 inoculated plants. These results extend the knowledge on colonization of onions by fungal endophytes and their effects on <italic>Thrips tabaci</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by the BMZ (The German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development) through GIZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft f&#x000fc;r Internationale Zusammenarbeit) through a project grant entitled &#x0201c;Implementation of integrated thrips and tospovirus management strategies in small-holder vegetable cropping systems of Eastern Africa&#x0201c; (Project number: 11.7860.7-001.00, Contract number: 81141840) to which we are grateful.

(Asparagales: Amaryllidaceae), are grown in all regions by both large- and small-scale farmers, where they have a ready domestic and regional market <xref rid="pone.0108242-Narla1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Onion thrips, <italic>Thrips tabaci</italic> Lindeman (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), is considered the most economically important pest of onion worldwide <xref rid="pone.0108242-Nawrocka1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108242-DiazMontano1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In Kenya, it is present in all onion growing areas and can cause up to 59% loss in yield <xref rid="pone.0108242-Waiganjo1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Currently, growers manage thrips by applying insecticides which are ineffective due to the cryptic feeding behavior of thrips, overlapping generations and insecticide resistance <xref rid="pone.0108242-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108242-Morse1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Therefore, an integrated approach that includes the use of entomopathogens, cultural practices, host plant resistance and judicious use of insecticides is needed <xref rid="pone.0108242-Maniania1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108242-Shiberu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) are considered as important biocontrol agents (BCAs). They are traditionally applied in an inundative approach <xref rid="pone.0108242-Ekesi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, but recent studies have shown that EPF play diverse roles in nature including as endophytes <xref rid="pone.0108242-Vega1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Indeed, the endophytic niche in a plant is a rich source of microorganisms that can directly and indirectly promote plant growth and development through plant defence against herbivorous insects <xref rid="pone.0108242-Jallow1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and plant pathogens <xref rid="pone.0108242-Stone1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108242-Ownley1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> due to their ability to produce secondary metabolites with biocidal activity <xref rid="pone.0108242-Stone2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108242-Strobel1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. On a wide variety of crops, fungal endophytes have been reported to deter feeding, oviposition and performance of stem boring, sap sucking, chewing, and leaf mining insects <xref rid="pone.0108242-Jallow1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108242-Cherry1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108242-Qi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108242-Akutse1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. For example, endophytic colonization of banana by <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic> significantly reduced larval survivorship of banana weevil, <italic>Cosmopolites sordidus</italic> (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), resulting in 42&#x02013;87% reduction in plant damage <xref rid="pone.0108242-Akello1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Reduction in feeding and reproduction by <italic>Aphis gossypii</italic> (Hemiptera: Aphididae) has also been reported on cotton endophytically colonized by either <italic>B. bassiana</italic> or <italic>Lecanicillium lecanii</italic> (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) <xref rid="pone.0108242-Gurulingappa1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>Advantages of the application of endophytes over conventional foliar application of fungal entomopathogens <xref rid="pone.0108242-Maniania1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref><xref rid="pone.0108242-Maniania2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> are the ability to colonize plants systemically, thereby offering continuous protection and enhanced persistence <xref rid="pone.0108242-Akello2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Moreover, considerably low inoculum is required when applied as seed treatment <xref rid="pone.0108242-Athman1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, colonization of a host plant by an endophyte is influenced by the inoculation method, species of fungal endophytes and the host plant species itself. Based on the inoculation technique, the endophytes differ in their ability to colonize different plant parts and to persist over a crop growth cycle <xref rid="pone.0108242-Bing1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108242-Akello3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108242-Brownbridge1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Akello et al. <xref rid="pone.0108242-Akello3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> reported a higher colonization of tissue-cultured banana by <italic>B. bassiana</italic> through dipping roots and rhizome in a conidial suspension as compared to injecting a conidial suspension into the plant rhizome and by growing the plants in sterile soil mixed with <italic>B. bassiana</italic>-colonized rice substrate. Bing and Lewis <xref rid="pone.0108242-Bing1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> reported improved colonization of corn plants through foliar spray of conidia as compared to injection of conidia suspension. They also demonstrated the ability of <italic>B. bassiana</italic> to invade maize plants through the epidermis, thereafter persisting in the plant through the entire growing season, which conferred crop resistance against damage by European corn borer. However, information on endophyte colonization of onions and impact of endophytes on thrips infesting onions is not available. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of two procedures, seed and seedling inoculation methods, on colonization of onion plants by fungal endophytes and further assess their impact on infestation by onion thrips, and on thrips feeding and oviposition. Post-inoculation recovery of all the endophytes tested wase highest with seed inoculation method compared to seedling inoculation method, and this method was selected for the additional impact studies with thrips.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study was not undertaken in a national park or any other protected areas of land.

The endophytes were isolated from onion plants asymptomatic of any pathogenic infection, collected during a field survey conducted in different altitudinal gradients of Kenya, namely Nakuru (00.01 N 36.26 E, 2000 m.a.s.l.), Loitokitok (02.71 S 37.53 E, 1200 m.a.s.l.) and Kibwezi (02.25 S 38.08 E, 825 m.a.s.l.) as detailed in the GenBank Accessions mentioned above. Two fungal isolates (<italic>Hypocrea lixii</italic> F3ST1 and <italic>Trichoderma asperellum</italic> M2RT4) isolated from the aboveground parts of maize and sorghum, and previously reported endophytic on maize and bean seedlings <xref rid="pone.0108242-Akello4" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, were also included. Conidia were obtained from two-week-old cultures grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates. The conidia were harvested by scraping the surface of sporulating cultures with a sterile scalpel. The harvested conidia were then placed in universal bottles with 10 ml sterile distilled water containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and vortexed for 5 min to produce homogenous conidial suspensions. The conidial concentration was determined using Neubauer hemocytometer. The conidial concentration was adjusted to 1&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> conidia mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> through dilution prior to inoculation of seeds and seedlings.</p><p>To assess the viability of the conidia, 100 &#x000b5;L of conidial suspension was inoculated to the surface of two fresh plates of PDA for each isolate. A sterile microscope cover slip (2&#x000d7;2 cm) was placed on top of the agar in each plate before incubation. The inoculated plates were incubated for 24 h at 20&#x000b0;C. The percentage conidial germination was assessed by counting the number of germinated conidia out of 100 in one randomly selected field. Conidia were considered as germinated when germ tubes exceeded half of the diameter of the conidium. The percent germination of the different isolates exceeded 90%, which is recommended by Parsa et al. <xref rid="pone.0108242-Parsa1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Insects</title><p>Initial cultures of T. tabaci were field-collected from onion plants at the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (icipe) organic farm.

For instance, seed inoculation method resulted in superior colonization of onion plants as compared to the seedling inoculation. The difference in colonization between the two may be explained in part by a reduced capacity of uninoculated seedlings to enhance endophyte proliferation due to transplantation shock <xref rid="pone.0108242-Barrows1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Moreover, endophyte inoculation at seed stage could have the advantage of colonizing both seed radical and the plumule, which are close to one another in the seed. Tefera and Vidal <xref rid="pone.0108242-Tefera1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> reported that seed inoculation of sorghum plants with <italic>B. bassiana</italic> resulted to good endophyte colonization in vermiculate and sterile soil substrates. Seed inoculation could be advantageous in terms of low inoculums requirement as compared to augmentative sprays <xref rid="pone.0108242-Athman1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Further seed treatment could provide opportunities for endophytic fungi colonization at the young seedling stage for early protection and enhanced seedling health. Backman and Sikora <xref rid="pone.0108242-Backman1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> outlined that, integrated pest management on seeds reduces costs and environmental impact, while allowing the biological agent to build up momentum for biological control. Posada et al. <xref rid="pone.0108242-Posada1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> found that direct injection of <italic>B. bassiana</italic> conidial suspensions had the highest post-inoculation recovery in coffee seedlings than foliar sprays, stem injections, or soil drenches. Our results show that there were differences in the level of colonization of different plant parts by fungal isolates. For instance, roots sections had higher colonization as compared to stems and leaves. These differences could be due to tissue specificity exhibited by endophytic fungi and their adaptation to particular physiological conditions of the plants <xref rid="pone.0108242-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Similar results were reported on French beans and Faba beans <xref rid="pone.0108242-Akutse1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and coffee <xref rid="pone.0108242-Posada1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p><p>Among the endophytes that colonized onion plants, <italic>C. rosea</italic> ICIPE 707, <italic>H. lixii</italic> F3ST1, <italic>T. harzianum</italic> ICIPE 709, <italic>T. atroviride</italic> ICIPE 710, and <italic>T. asperellum</italic> M2RT4 had significantly low proportion of thrips, number of feeding punctures and eggs. However, isolate <italic>H. lixii</italic> F3ST1 had the highest overall negative impact on <italic>T. tabaci</italic>. Lately, the impacts of fungal endophytes on suppression of different insect groups in different host plants are receiving increased attention <xref rid="pone.0108242-Cherry1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108242-Akutse1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108242-Vega2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The negative effect on the proportion of thrips on the endophyte-colonized plants as compared to the control could have been responsible for reduced feeding and oviposition. For instance, Akutse et al. <xref rid="pone.0108242-Akutse1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> reported that Faba beans colonized endophytically by fungal endophytes of the genera <italic>Hypocrea</italic> and <italic>Beauveria</italic> had significant negative effects on leafminer, <italic>Liriomyza huidobrensis</italic> (Blanchard) fitness, impacting on mortality, oviposition, emergence and longevity of the pest. Cherry et al. <xref rid="pone.0108242-Cherry1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> found a reduced number of <italic>Sesamia calamistis</italic> (Hampson) in <italic>B. bassiana</italic>-inoculated plants compared to non-inoculated plants. Thrips are able to distinguish among plants as suitable for feeding and/or oviposition sites to ensure fitness of their progeny <xref rid="pone.0108242-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. <italic>Thrips tabaci</italic> is a key vector of <italic>Iris yellow spot virus</italic> (IYSV) in Kenya <xref rid="pone.0108242-Lehtonen1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108242-Birithia1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> and the thrips densities are positively associated with IYSV incidence <xref rid="pone.0108242-Birithia2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108242-Kritzman1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108242-Schwartz1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Hence, the reduced feeding by the thrips on endophyte-colonized plants could potentially reduce the transmission of IYSV in onions. Moreover, fungal endophytes can decrease plant virus infections in plants as reported in meadow ryegrass with the <italic>Barley yellow dwarf virus</italic> (BYDV) <xref rid="pone.0108242-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. The broad array of endophyte induced defence mechanisms in plants against insect pests such as production of toxic or distasteful chemicals <xref rid="pone.0108242-Tibbets1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> and pathogenic interaction to insects <xref rid="pone.0108242-Marcelino1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> could decrease insect fitness <xref rid="pone.0108242-Akello5" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, a phenomenon that needs to be further investigated.</p><p>In the present study, dead insects did not present any signs of mycosis. Previous studies have also revealed that dead insects recovered from endophytically-colonized plants exhibit no signs of fungal infection <xref rid="pone.0108242-Cherry1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108242-Akutse1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The influence of endophytes colonizing onions on thrips biology in terms of observable proportion, feeding and oviposition in the present study are in accordance with the findings by Cherry et al. <xref rid="pone.0108242-Cherry1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and Bittleston et al. <xref rid="pone.0108242-Bittleston1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> on reduced feeding and by Akutse et al. <xref rid="pone.0108242-Akutse1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> on oviposition with other endophytes and pests. The reduced feeding and oviposition could have been a result of either reduced survival of thrips or antixenotic repellence of thrips, phenomena that warrant further studies to unravel the underlying mechanisms such as possible release of metabolites and/or volatiles which could have effects on thrips.</p><p>Isolates <italic>C. rosea</italic> ICIPE 707, <italic>H. lixii</italic> F3ST1, <italic>T. harzianum</italic> ICIPE 709, <italic>T. atroviride</italic> ICIPE 710, and <italic>T. asperellum</italic> M2RT4 effectively colonized the various plant parts of onion as compared to the <italic>Fusarium</italic> isolates. Consequently, isolate <italic>H. lixii</italic> F3ST1 had the most antagonistic impact on onion thrips and it could be used to develop alternative and ecologically safe management strategy for onion thrips. We conclude that, onions can be successfully inoculated especially through seeds, with different fungal endophytes. However, further studies are warranted to determine the persistence of tested endophytes in the colonized plants under natural conditions and investigate potential for vertical transmission of endophytes. Additionally, being the first report of antagonistic activity of endophytes colonizing onion against <italic>T. tabaci</italic>, it would be crucial to determine the underlying mechanisms of such multi-trophic interactions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs J.
