The presence of ants and the availability of extrafloral nectar were manipulated in a stratified random design. Insect communities were monitored and recorded over a period of six months with a view to addressing three main questions. Do ants provide biotic defense against key herbivores on <italic>S</italic>. <italic>chapmanii</italic>? Is the presence of ants on <italic>S</italic>. <italic>chapmanii</italic> mediated by EFN? Finally, are there ecological costs associated with the presence of ants on <italic>S</italic>. <italic>chapmanii</italic>, such as a reduction in alternative predator or parasitoid numbers? Herbivores on <italic>S</italic>. <italic>chapmanii</italic> included immature stages of three pierid butterflies, and adult weevils. Eight species of ants were associated with the plants, and other predators included spiders, ladybugs, wasps, and hemipterans. Parasitic, haemolymph-sucking midges (Ceratopogonidae) and parasitoid flies were also associated with the caterpillar herbivores, and possibly the extrafloral nectaries of the plants. The presence of ants did not appear to influence oviposition by butterflies, as numbers of lepidopterans of all developmental stages did not differ among treatments. Significantly more late instar caterpillars, however, were observed on plants with ants excluded, indicating that ants remove small caterpillars from plants. Substantially more alternative predators (spiders, ladybugs, and wasps) were observed on plants with ants excluded. Rates of parasitization did not differ among the treatments, but there were substantially fewer caterpillars succumbing to virus among those collected from control plants.</p><p>We provide a rare look at facultative ant-plant mutualisms in the context of the many other interactions with which they overlap. We conclude that ants provide some biotic defense against herbivores on <italic>S</italic>. <italic>chapmanii</italic>, and plants benefit overall from the presence of ants, despite negative impacts on non-ant predators.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Support was provided by sabbatical leave support and a subsequent research grant to SK from the College of Arts and Sciences at FIU.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="18"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All arthropod census data and caterpillar rearing files are available from the Dryad database: doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.47ct0">10.5061/dryad.47ct0</ext-link>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All arthropod census data and caterpillar rearing files are available from the Dryad database: doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.47ct0">10.5061/dryad.47ct0</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) have been reported in 93 plant families and 332 genera [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and may be found on almost any vegetative or reproductive plant structure [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. While extrafloral nectar (EFN) may be consumed by a broad range of arthropods, its discovery by ants is thought to be of greatest importance to plant defense [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While defending their resource, many ant species show territorial aggressiveness towards, or even prey on other insects that they encounter [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Since Thomas Belt first hypothesized the mutualism between plants and defensive ants [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], many studies have supported ants as biotic defenders of plants [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Ant-plants may be placed into two categories based on their defensive strategy. Myrmecophytic plants provide nesting sites and are permanently occupied by specialized ant species, while myrmecophylic plants provide unspecialized food rewards, most commonly extrafloral nectar (EFN) or honeydew (through associations with honeydew producing hemipterans), and foster only facultative interactions with ants. While the defensive role of ants on myrmecophytic plants is well supported [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the defensive benefits of EFN attracted ants have been empirically demonstrated only relatively rarely [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Indeed, several studies of EFN mediated ant-plant interactions have observed neutral or even negative effects on plant fitness [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In some cases the chemical composition of EFN appears to be tailored to attract defensive ants, and discourage exploiters [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Many facultative mutualisms between ants and EFN producing plants, however, offer low levels of species specificity and nectar is, therefore, available to be exploited by a host of arthropods which may confer no benefits to the plant (nectar thieves), and may even deter ants [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For example, 14 families of Diptera and 5 families of wasps have been observed at the EFNs of Lima beans alone [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The importance of EFN on the biology of non-ant consumers, however, has rarely been studied [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Ants, themselves, vary in their defensive qualities [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and even the most effective ant bodyguards may not be exclusively beneficial for plants [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Mutualisms between plants and ants do not occur in isolation, but within a complex web of biotic interactions. In the cactus <italic>Ferocactus wislizeni</italic>, for example, plants defended by the most aggressive ants, <italic>Solenopsis xyloni</italic>, suffer reduced herbivory and produce more flowers. Those flowers, however, receive fewer and shorter visits from pollinators, deterred by the same ferocious ants [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Other studies have also observed that pollinators recognize the danger posed by ants [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Assun&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] placed plastic ants on the petals of <italic>Heteropterys pteropetala</italic>. Flowers with plastic ants produced significantly less fruit than control flowers. Aggressive ants have also been observed to reduce the numbers of other beneficial insects, such as predators and parasitoids, on EFN bearing plants [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the EFN bearing tree, <italic>Qualea multiflora</italic>, both ants and spiders reduce herbivory rates, and an interaction effect has been observed whereby the best protected plants are those that harbor both ants and spiders. In many cases, however, ants outcompete spiders, with detrimental effects on plant defense [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Conflict between mutualistic guilds (bodyguards, pollinators, parasitoids) represents an important and understudied ecological cost of indirect plant defenses, and may be most prevalent in generalized systems where there is greater variation in partner quality and the relative importance of each mutualism. If we hope to understand the ecological role of EFN, along with the costs and benefits of ant-plant mutualisms, we must consider the whole network of interactions in which they exist. Ant-plant associations have been described as keystone interactions with the potential to dramatically alter the structure of arthropod communities [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The temporal dynamics of such mutualisms, however, and the balance of costs and benefits received by the plant, have rarely been studied in the context of the community [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p><italic>Senna</italic> is a relatively large genus (300&#x02013;350 species) of Caesalpinoid legumes, and one of the three richest genera in terms of the number of EFN bearing species, along with <italic>Passiflora</italic> and <italic>Inga</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The diversification of <italic>Senna</italic> has been attributed to the evolution of EFNs, facilitating interactions with opportunistic ants, and the exploitation of newly arising ecological niches [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although the ecology of EFNs in <italic>Senna</italic> is not well understood, there have been a number of studies on EFN mediated interactions in <italic>Senna</italic> and closely related taxa.</p><p>In the present study we observed and recorded insect activity in <italic>Senna mexicana</italic> var. <italic>chapmanii</italic> (hereafter referred to as <italic>Senna chapmanii</italic>) over a period of six months, and compiled a large database of species occurring on our study plants. We examined the role of EFN in mediating ant-plant interactions in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>chapmanii</italic>, as well as the effects of ants on predator and herbivore numbers. Additionally, we investigated how the presence of ants affects the rate of parasitization in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>chapmanii</italic>&#x02019;s key herbivores, the Sulphur butterflies. Ant protection of caterpillars against parasitoids has been observed several times through the experimental exclusion of ants [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In one such exclusion experiment, parasitization by tachinid flies and braconid wasps, resulted in 78% mortality in <italic>Hemiargus isola</italic> (Lepidotera: Lycaenidae) larvae, almost twice that observed in the presence of tending ants [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>In this study, 60 seedlings of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>chapmanii</italic> were planted in semi-natural growing conditions. The presence of ants and the availability of EFN were manipulated to test three major hypotheses. First, we predicted that ants on <italic>S</italic>. <italic>chapmanii</italic> would provide defense against herbivores such as pierid butterflies. Secondly, we hypothesized that the presence of ants would be mediated by the availability of EFN. Finally, we predicted that, despite their defensive benefits, the presence of ants would come at some ecological cost to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>chapmanii</italic> plants, specifically, a reduction in the numbers of other predatory insects, or the rate of herbivore parasitization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>Seeds for plants cultivated for our experiment were collected from Camp Owaissa Bauer under Research Permit # 0021 to SK, Natural Areas Management Miami-Dade County Park and Recreation Department.

The mean annual precipitation is 1496 mm. The site elevation is close to sea level, and consists of flat calcareous limestone rocklands that have been rock-plowed for agriculture. We utilized a 2 acre restoration area within the site. The restoration area was a rockland hammock, previously overgrown with exotic pest plants, that had been mostly cleared of all vegetation except for some large native trees in the center and on a few edges. Within 5 m of the western edge there is a stand of pine rockland habitat, a protected natural area.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Study species</title><p><italic>Senna</italic> Miller (Fabaceae: Caesalpinoideae), formerly included in the genus <italic>Cassia</italic>, is a genus of 300&#x02013;340 species, of which 80% occur in the New World [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. <italic>Senna</italic> spp. are mostly woody perennials with parapinnate leaves, some bearing foliar nectaries between the lowest pair of opposite leaflets (varying among species) [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. <italic>Senna mexicana</italic> (Jacq.)

This species grows in pine rockland habitat and rockland hammock edges as an upright or sprawling subshrub, up to 1.2 m in height, spreading broader than tall.

After 3 months, sixty plants were transplanted into the experimental site on the grounds of the University of Florida Tropical Research Experiment Station, in an area of approximately 8000m<sup>2</sup>. Plants were installed in an evenly spaced array, over the open areas not occupied by dense vegetation. Each plant was at least 4m from its nearest neighbor. Treatments were assigned systematically to ensure even distribution of treatments across the site. Plants were mulched with wood chips, and watered for two months until they were established.</p><p>The experiment consisted of four treatments, in which the presence of ants and the availability of EFN were manipulated. The two independent variables were ants (present or excluded) and EFN (available or unavailable). The sixty plants were randomly assigned to one of four treatments as follows: 1) Ants removed, and a sticky resin (Tanglefoot&#x02122;) applied to the base of branches to prevent the transit of ants and other crawling insects; this treatment is designated TF. 2) Ants present: ants removed manually to control for the effects of removal, such as shaking of branches, but no tanglefoot applied, so their return was not prevented; this is the control designated C. 3) Nail polish (Sally Hansen &#x0201c;Hard as Nails&#x0201d;) applied to all nectaries on the plant to reduce nectar available to all visitors; this treatment is designated NP. 4) Nail polish dabbed on the back of each leaf, to test for its potential repellent effects; this treatment is designated NPC. Nylon nail polish effectively seals the nectaries and eliminates nectar production [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] without damaging plant tissues on this species and others with fairly sturdy leaves. The assigned treatment was applied to three branches of each plant, and reapplied weekly throughout the course of the experiment. The arthropod censuses and collections were made from the selected branches. Though originally there were 15 plants in each treatment, final sample sizes of plants monitored were TF = 12, C = 15, NP = 12, and NPC = 11.</p><p>Plants were transplanted in March 2003, the cooler dry season in south Florida, so irrigation was needed to aid their establishment until the summer rains came in late May. Plants were all similar in size initially, but some grew taller and others broader, depending on their genotype. We chose branches that were held upright and did not touch the ground, and trimmed overlapping branches to eliminate pathways for crawling insects to access treatment branches. Observations began in the fall rainy season, September 2003, and exclusion experiments started in October 2003. The experiment continued through February 2004, a period of six months, spanning both the wet and dry season (from December onward). In nature, plants flower and fruit year round, though flowering is greater from November through May (personal observations).</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Data collection</title><p>Throughout the field season a weekly census was conducted for each plant during the morning hours (dawn until mid-day), always with sunny or partly cloudy weather, during which insect numbers were counted, and their behaviors monitored, on the three target branches. Predatory arthropods such as ants, spiders, wasps, bugs, ladybugs and flies, were noted along with whether they visited nectaries, removed herbivores, or fed on other insects. Vouchers were collected where species determination was necessary. Herbivores on the plants were also recorded (leaf-chewing weevils, and larvae of pierid butterflies and tortricid moths), but only the larvae of pierid butterflies were intensively sampled. Numbers of small larvae (1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> instars) were recorded, while mature (3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> instar) caterpillars were recorded, collected, and reared to glean information on rates of parasitization and disease. The larvae of tortricid moths were sporadically collected and reared for information on their species identity and parasitization. For each type of arthropod we counted the number of individuals at each census, except for ants, flies, and weevils, where only the presence or absence of each species was noted.</p><p>Caterpillars were maintained individually in the laboratory, in 1-gallon plastic bags, and fed on leaves until they died or pupated. Caterpillars/Pupae were kept in the bags until the emergence of adult butterflies or, in the case of dead or morbid individuals, until the emergence of parasitoids (such individuals were placed in plastic Falcon &#x02122; tubes with loosened caps). Emerging butterflies or parasitoids could then be identified.</p><p>For each pierid caterpillar collected, we recorded whether it survived to adulthood or died. For those caterpillars that died, it was determined if their death was a result of parasitization (where a parasitoid was seen to emerge) or from a virus. The most common parasitoid, a tachinid fly, usually emerged as a larva from the pierid butterfly chrysalis, and pupated in the container. We later found that some of these flies pupated within the chrysalis, and died while emerging from both pupae cases. Some fly larvae presumably died before emergence, and were not detected. By this stage specimens were often desiccated to such an extent as to prevent reliable analysis and, therefore, it was not always possible to determine the exact cause of death. In such cases we assigned the category &#x0201c;maybe parasitized&#x0201d;. Virus infected caterpillars exhibited discoloration and turned black shortly after death; virus infected pupae neither eclosed a butterfly nor a parasitoid, but turned either black or a mosaic of colors. Dead specimens (larvae and pupae, presumed to be killed by virus) collected over the study were later sent to L. Solter (Illinois Natural History Survey) for examination, to determine if there was evidence of virus or microsporidia. This turned out to be impossible to determine as our specimens, left in tubes at room temperature, had acquired fungi and other decomposers that interfered with her observations; no one common pathogenic agent could be identified from these specimens.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Data analysis</title><p>We summed the occurrences of all types of insects on each plant (actual counts for most types; only presence/absence for ants, flies, and weevils) over the course of the experiment. We used sums rather than averages as it was unlikely that individual insects would be on the same plant (except for caterpillars, which were removed at the third instar and later for rearing). Where actual numbers were recorded, counts were compared among treatments using Univariate Analysis of Variance. Where only presence/absence was recorded, insect occurrence was compared using Contingency Tables and the Kruskal-Wallis test (SPSS version 11).</p><p>Analyses were performed with both actual data of occurrences of the various arthropod groups and square-root transformed data, which always gave the same results, so we report the results with the actual data. Some plants died during the course of the experiment, succumbing to fungal blight; data from all plants that lived for at least two months were included. Post-hoc tests for between treatment comparisons were either Tukeys HSD (for equal variance) or Dunnet&#x02019;s C or Games-Howell (depending on the sample size).

During our study, EFNs in the inflorescences of flowering individuals may have augmented ant activity on nail polish treated branches, as they were not always covered with nail polish. Additionally, on large study plants, only the experimental branches were treated, so the availability of EFN on non-test branches likely accounts for many of the ants attracted to these plants.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that when ants are excluded from nectaries in this study system, the numbers of other predators are significantly increased (<xref rid="pone.0138157.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). The deterrence of other predators represents an important ecological cost of ant-plant interactions. Torres-Hernandez et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] also found that predator numbers on <italic>Turnera ulmifolia</italic> were increased when ants were excluded, and that these predators provided better defense against herbivores than some ant species. Spiders have been shown to enhance seed set of <italic>Chamaecrista nictitans</italic> host plants with extrafloral nectaries [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], even when ants are ineffective at repelling some herbivores [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Vespid wasps visit extrafloral nectaries and are voracious predators (and we observed several making &#x0201c;caterpillar meatballs&#x0201d; during the course of the study). Wasps attracted to the extrafloral nectaries of <italic>Turnera ulmifolia</italic> have been shown to positively affect plant reproductive output [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Coccinellidae larvae and adults have been observed to visit extrafloral nectaries ([<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and the present study) and consume a variety of arthropods. Feeding on nectar and honeydew has even been shown to enhance development and survival these omnivorous &#x0201c;predators&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0138157.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0138157.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Some players in the tritrophic system&#x02014;upper left, caterpillar of the orange-barred sulfur butterfly, <italic>Phoebis philea</italic>, on <italic>Senna chapmanii</italic>; upper right, pupa (chrysalis) of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sennae</italic>; lower left, adult <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sennae</italic>; lower right: caterpillar studded with sucking flies (virus transmitters?).</title><p>When viruses are involved, the pupae do not hatch, but instead turn various colors.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0138157.g007"/></fig><p>In this study, neither the presence of ants, nor the availability of EFN, affected the rates of parasitization in pierid caterpillars. Although several studies have observed ants defending caterpillars from parasitoids [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], these studies involved ant-tended lepidopteran species that are known to provide ants with sugary resources in return for defense. It has been observed [James Spencer, personal communication] that sulphur caterpillars at times produce tiny droplets on the tips of setae covering their bodies, but the potential role of this liquid as an ant reward, or ant-deterrent, has not yet been investigated. We have never observed caterpillar-tending behavior by ants, but the droplets may play a role in caterpillar protection (presently under investigation).</p><p>A surprising observation was that on control plants, where ant activity was high, fewer caterpillars died from viruses. We also observed that caterpillars collected from these plants had a higher rate of successful emergence as adults, although the result was not quite significant in this case. A variety of predators and parasitoids (Coccinellid larvae, tachinid flies, and parasitic wasps) have been shown to carry viable nuclear polyhedrosis virus [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. It is possible; therefore, that the deterrence of predators by ants may explain the low rates of viral infection seen in caterpillars collected from control plants. An alternative explanation is that ants may disproportionally predate upon virus infected caterpillars, leading to lower rates of virus infection in reared caterpillars. While we view this explanation as unlikely, future work could determine if virus infected caterpillars are more or less vulnerable to predation.</p><p>An unanticipated dimension of the study was the discovery of caterpillar-sucking midges that might have a role in spreading virus and thereby controlling caterpillars. Ceratopogonidae midges (<italic>Forcipomyia</italic> (<italic>Microhelea</italic>) <italic>eriophora</italic>) were first observed feeding on <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sennae</italic> during this study, and the phenomenon was later observed several times in natural settings. The parasitized larvae were collected, and died at higher rates in captivity than is expected in rearings of this species [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It might be that these Ceratopogonidae midges are not as likely to suck caterpillars in the presence of ants, but more work is needed to test this, as well as the virus transmission hypothesis [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Like many EFN producing plants, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>chapmanii</italic> appears to engage in non-specialist facultative interactions with ants. In this study alone, the EFNs of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>chapmanii</italic> were regularly visited by eight species of ants. In addition to attracting small numbers of workers to defend against herbivores, some EFN producing plants may also attract ants to nest beneath the plants, increasing the reliability of defense and potentially providing additional nutrients in the soil [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138157.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In this experiment, of the thirty plants with available EFNs, eleven had fire ant nests at their base. Study plants were mulched to prevent the growth of weeds that might function as &#x02018;ant-bridges&#x02019;, and this mulch may have contributed to the attraction of nesting ants, however, this unexpectedly high occurrence of nests surely warrants further investigation. Indeed, the outcomes of ant-plant mutualisms must ultimately depend more on the dynamics of colonies, than the behavior of individual workers, and we are not the first to suggest that future work might use colonies, rather than workers, as the unit of study [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>We have previously shown that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>chapmanii</italic> plants produce more EFN in response to leaf damage, and that the same leaf damage elicits increased ant activity on the plants [<xref rid="pone.0138157.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Although not comprehensive, the present study provides a record of many insects found on <italic>S</italic>. <italic>chapmanii</italic>, and represents a rare effort to describe EFN mediated ant-plant interactions in the context of the many other interactions around which they occur. We provide strong evidence that ants remove key herbivores from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>chapmanii</italic>, and future work should focus on how ants affect plant reproductive fitness in this system.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank many for help with the field work during the course of this project: Daniel Gomez, Lisa Gonzalez, Lisa Hoang, John J.
