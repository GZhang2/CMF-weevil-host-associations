               <p>The pea leaf weevil, 
                  <i>Sitona lineatus</i> L. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), has recently emerged as an important pest of field
                  peas in the Canadian prairies. Systemic seed-coated insecticides may provide a tool
                  for the integrated pest management of this pest. Therefore, several controlled assays
                  were performed in order to determine effects of a recently registered neonicotinoid,
                  (thiamethoxam) on 
                  <i>S. lineatus</i> damage to foliage, weevil mortality, fertility, egg viability, larval mortality,
                  and root nodule damage. Foliage damage was reduced by thiamethoxam relative to untreated
                  controls during the seedling stage (2
                  <sup>nd</sup>–5
                  <sup>th</sup> nodes), but weevil adult mortality was only 15–30%. Fertility was reduced substantially
                  through an extra seven-day delay in the preoviposition period and reduced egg-laying
                  rate during the first 20 days of the study (92% lower than controls). Overall egg
                  viability was lower in females fed foliage grown from thiamethoxamtreated seeds. Larval
                  survivorship and nodule damage were also lower, but only when eggs were added to treated
                  plants at the 2
                  <sup>nd</sup> node stage. When eggs were added late, at the 5th node stage, thiamethoxam had no
                  effect on larval survivorship or nodule damage. The results of this study led to the
                  conclusion that seed treatments such as thiamethoxam have potential to be used as
                  tools that will aid in the integrated pest management of 
                  <i>S. lineatus</i>, especially in combination with other methods such as biocontrol and trap crops.

            <p>The pea leaf weevil, 
               <i>Sitona lineatus</i> L. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is a common pest of peas (
               <i>Pisum sativum</i> L (Fabales: Fabaceae) and faba beans (
               <i>Vicia faba</i> L.) in Europe, North Africa, and North America. It has recently expanded its range
               to the Canadian Prairies, a significant pea production area (
               <a href="#bibr19">Vankosky et al. 2009</a>). The life cycle of 
               <i>Sitona</i> weevils was described in detail by Jackson (
               <a href="#bibr09">1920</a>). Adults of 
               <i>S. lineatus</i> overwinter in perennial legume crops, field margins, or shelters, then migrate to
               pea fields in the spring and produce characteristic Ushaped notches on foliage. Within
               a few days, females scatter their eggs on the soil surface around pea seedlings and
               continue ovipositing throughout the summer. Larvae feed on 
               <i>Rhizobium</i> root nodules, which can potentially reduce yield if soil is nitrogen deficient (
               <a href="#bibr05">Cárcamo and Vankosky 2011</a>). The immature stages last 6–8 weeks, and adults of the new generation emerge in
               mid-late summer to continue feeding on any green foliage of plants of the Fabaceae
               family.
            </p>
            <p>Managing 
               <i>S. lineatus</i> has relied on foliar or seed-coated insecticides with variable results. In general,
               foliar insecticides do not seem to provide sufficient control to prevent larval damage
               to nodules, despite reductions in adult foliage consumption (
               <a href="#bibr15">Seidenglanz et al. 2010</a>; 
               <a href="#bibr05">Cárcamo and Vankosky 2011</a>). A number of seed-coated or soil-incorporated systemic insecticides have been used
               with some degree of success. For example, Bardner et al. (
               <a href="#bibr03">1983</a>) and Lee and Upton (
               <a href="#bibr10">1992</a>) suggested that phorate and bendiocarb, respectively, may improve yield of peas when
               
               <i>S. lineatus</i> reach pest levels. A summary of the 13 chemicals used for this pest was provided
               by Vankosky et al. (
               <a href="#bibr19">2009</a>), and again suggested variable success in controlling this pest. Thiamethoxam is
               a neonicotinoid seed-coated insecticide recently registered for 
               <i>S. lineatus</i> in field peas in Canada (
               <a href="#bibr07">Government of Alberta 2011</a>), initially as an emergency registration to provide growers with an option to manage
               this pest. Thiamethoxam is efficient in controlling leaf hoppers in potatoes (
               <a href="#bibr12">Nault et al. 2004</a>) and provided sufficient crop protection against wireworms in cereals (
               <a href="#bibr20">Vernon et al. 2009</a>). However, the mechanism of action with respect to its efficacy for 
               <i>S. lineatus</i> other than reduction of foliage damage remained unknown. For example, insecticide
               expression in the roots and nodules and effects on larvae are poorly known. 
               <i>Rhizobium</i> nodules vary in size and physiological status as they age (
               <a href="#bibr08">Groten et al. 2005</a>). Higher number of larger, tumescent (branched) nodules in plants with insecticide
               seed treatment may indicate higher nodule survivorship in those plants.
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, studies of this and similar neonicotineoid insecticides have suggested
               selective mortality or sub-lethal effects on insect fitness. For example, a related
               compound, imidacloprid, increased the fertility of 
               <i>Tetranychus urticae</i> Koch and may explain increases in populations of this mite when this insecticide
               was sprayed against psyllids on pears (Beer and Himmel 2002). Therefore, in the context
               of assessing this registered seed treatment as a tool to improve the integrated pest
               management of 
               <i>S. lineatus</i>, several greenhouse and laboratory studies were conducted in order to determine the
               effects of thiamethoxam on adult damage to pea plants, weevil mortality and fecundity,
               egg viability, larval mortality, and damage to root nodules.

               <p>Weevils for Tests 1 and 2 were field collected in the spring and summer of 2008, respectively,
                  from plots of field peas in the vicinity of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. Insects were
                  picked off the ground around pea plants and placed in 0.5 L plastic containers with
                  pea foliage and kept at room temperature until required. Tests 3 and 4 were conducted
                  in the spring of 2009 using weevils that were collected in high numbers on a combine
                  table while a farmer combined his pea field near Vulcan, Alberta, in September 2008.
                  These weevils were fed alfalfa for two weeks prior to being overwintered at 5° C until
                  3 February 2009, when they were brought to room temperature and fed sprouted alfalfa.
               </p>
               <p>For Test 5, conducted in 2010, weevil stock was obtained by overwintering adults collected
                  on 24 August 2009 from field tests in cages with pea plants grown in 2009. These weevils
                  were fed alfalfa for two weeks prior to overwintering at 5° C. They were transferred
                  from 5° C to 20° C on 7 January 2010 and fed alfalfa for one week.

               <p>A series of assays, replicated at least 10 times, using 
                  <i>S. lineatus</i> adults were performed in a greenhouse in order to assess the effects of thiamethoxam
                  on foliage damage, adult mortality, reproductive potential, and egg viability. All
                  seed used in all tests (1–5) was treated with Apron Max® (6.5 g/100 kg seed), a fungicide
                  package for various canola seedling diseases (Syngenta Canada Inc., 
                  <a href="http://www.syngenta.com/">http://www.syngenta.com/</a>). During the day of planting, the peat inoculant N Prove containing 
                  <i>Rhizobium leguminosarum</i> (7.4 × 10
                  <sup>8</sup> viable cells per gram from Novozyme Biologicals, 
                  <a href="http://www.novozymes.com/">http://www.novozymes.com/</a>) was applied to pea seed of all treatments (except treatment 1 of Test 1) at a rate
                  of 0.17 g per 100 g of pea seed. Although cultivars varied among some of the trials,
                  no plant genetic effects were expected or observed, as host plant resistance is rare
                  for this insect pest (see review by 
                  <a href="#bibr19">Vankosky et al. 2009</a>).
               </p>
               <p>Test 1 was designed to determine thiamethoxam insecticide dose effects on pea foliage
                  damage. Two males and two females were added to a pot containing two pea plants (or
                  one pair of weevils if only one plant survived) confined with a sleeve mesh cage constructed
                  with Dacron Chiffon (Bioquip, 
                  <a href="http://www.bioquip.com/">http://www.bioquip.com/</a>; Product 7250C). The six treatments tested are listed in 
                  <a href="#t01_01">Table 1</a>. In Test 2, the effect of plant density and insecticide treatment on foliage damage
                  was tested. A similar meshed cage design was used in this test, but the density of
                  plants per cage (2, 4, and 8) was manipulated using a control of untreated seed and
                  a thiamethoxam (30 g a.i./100 kg seed, Syngenta Canada Inc.). Two cohorts of weevils
                  were used. The first was old reproductive weevils collected in early August and added
                  to plants at the second node stage on 5 August 2008. Weevils were removed after 48
                  hours and transferred to Petri dishes, where they were fed untreated foliage to determine
                  their mortality. The second batch of weevils was added around the 4–5
                  <sup>th</sup> node stage using young weevils of the new generation that were collected from pea
                  plots and added to the cages on 11 August 2008. Again, they were allowed to feed for
                  48 hours and later fed untreated foliage in Petri dishes. Foliage damage caused by
                  each cohort was recorded, and mortality of adults in Petri dishes was noted.

               <p>In Test 3 (insecticide effects on weevil fertility), the number of eggs laid by weevils
                  isolated in male/female pairs in Petri dishes and fed either foliage grown from treated
                  or untreated seed were measured. Pea plants were grown in root trainer pots (3.5 cm
                  × 11 cm) and four plants were allocated to provide foliage for each weevil pair for
                  the 41-day study. The two youngest fully expanded leaves from each node were fed to
                  the weevil pair. Dead weevils were replaced with one of the same sex. During each
                  feeding, mortality, number of eggs, notches on stipules, and frass spots were counted.
                  Foliage was visually rated for damage levels using a scale ranging from 0 to 3, with
                  0 = no feeding, 1 = few notches, 2 = several but distinct notches, and 3 = heavy,
                  numerous and coalesced notches. At growth stages 12 and 14, the foliage was scanned
                  using a flat bed scanner (Epson Perfection 4990) to determine quantitatively the amount
                  consumed by weevils using image analysis (Image Pro Plus v4.1). A subsample of 225
                  and 201 eggs from the control and thiamethoxam treatments, respectively, were kept
                  at 20° C and 18:6 L:D in snap-lock Petri dishes with moistened blotter paper to quantify
                  hatchability three times per week. Eggs were kept in groups of 2–59 eggs per dish,
                  but only those with at least 10 eggs were retained for statistical analysis.
               </p>
               <p>In Test 3, weevil mortality was assessed by examining weevils found on their back
                  for leg movement over a few minutes and declaring them dead if they stayed still on
                  their backs with no leg movement. However, it was subsequently learned that in other
                  beetle taxa (Elateridae; 
                  <a href="#bibr20">Vernon et al. 2009</a>), such assessment is inadequate as insects may recover after some time. Therefore,
                  to confirm mortality of weevils, Test 5 was performed (
                  <a href="#t01_01">Table 1</a>, “mortality re-assessment”). Plants were grown from thiamethoxam treated seed in
                  7.6 cm × 7.6 cm × 20 cm mini Tree pots (Stuewe and Sons, Tangent,
                  
                  <a href="http://www.stuewe.com/">http://www.stuewe.com/</a>; Product MT38) individually and enclosed with clear Plexiglas tube. At the 2nd node
                  stage, a male and female pair were added and observed daily during weekdays for two
                  weeks. Individuals that appeared dead (i.e., on their back and motionless) were kept
                  under observation for possible recovery for two weeks and carefully examined every
                  24 hours (except during weekends) under a microscope at 100× magnification for mandibular
                  twitching as suggested by Robert Vernon, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (personal
                  communication with H. Cárcamo).

               <p>Eggs from weevils fed untreated plants from the oviposition test described above were
                  stored at 20° C (18:6 L:D) in snap-lock Petri dishes with moistened blotter paper
                  and used to determine larval mortality and nodule damage in Test 4 (
                  <a href="#t01_01">Table 1</a>, “insecticide and crop stage interaction”). Groups of 40 eggs were added to mini
                  Tree Pots containing one pea plant allocated to the following four treatments (replicated
                  10 times): 1) control plants at 2
                  <sup>nd</sup> node; 2) control at 5
                  <sup>th</sup> node stage; 3) thiamethoxam treated plants at 2
                  <sup>nd</sup> node; 4) thiamethoxam treated plants at 5
                  <sup>th</sup> node. Plants were harvested at the early pod stage around 31–35 days after stocking
                  them with eggs. Total nodules were recorded according to their form (tumescent or
                  single), number of protuberances in each node, damaged or not, and expression of laeghemoglobin
                  (pink or not). The number of 
                  <i>S. lineatus</i> and their stage was noted (larva, pupa, adult).

                  of Variance using the Proc Mixed of SAS (version 9.2). Test 1 was analyzed using Repeated
                  Measures to determine differences in damage at the two crop stages by the same weevils
                  and possible interactions with the main effect (chemical treatment). For this test,
                  Tukey's adjustment was used to separate means (
                  <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) to account for the large number of treatments. In other tests with few treatments,
                  FPLSD (
                  <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) was used after ANOVA with SAS proc mixed indicated a significant model effect.
                  Where necessary, data were transformed using log (× +1), or, for proportional data,
                  the arc-sin transformation was used, but data are presented as raw means with one

                  was performed on ranked data and means separated as above. For the egg viability study,
                  only dishes with at least 10 eggs were kept for analysis of proportion of egg hatch
                  after it was transformed using the Arcsine option in Systat v. 12.

                  had significantly fewer notches, at either crop stage, than those grown from untreated
                  seed. The number of dead weevils (out of up to four individuals added per pot) was
                  very low (
                  <a href="#f01_01">Figure 1</a>) and ranged from 0.1 (thiamethoxam -5 g rate) to 0.7 in the thiamethoxam (-50 g rate).
                  Analysis of ranked data suggested that the highest rate of thiamethoxam (50 g) had
                  significantly higher mortality than the control without insecticide and the lowest
                  rate of thiamethoxam (5 g).
               </p>
               <p>In Test 2, plant density and chemical treatment influenced the number of notches per
                  plant but the two factors did not interact (
                  <a href="#t02_01">Table 2</a>). The number of notches per plant was lower in pots with 4 or 8 plants than in those
                  with 2 plants, regardless of insecticide treatment. In every case, for each plant
                  density, the plant damage was higher in the untreated seedlings compared to those
                  in seedlings grown from seed coated with thiamethoxam. Mortality of adults attributed
                  to insecticide seed coating was very low for the two weevil cohorts. For the old reproductive
                  weevils added to the plants at the 2
                  <sup>nd</sup> node stage, the total mortality out of 10 weevils, three days after stocking, ranged
                  from 1–2 in the controls and 3–4 in the pots with plants grown from seed coated with
                  thiamethoxam. For the new generation nonreproductive weevils added at the 4–5
                  <sup>th</sup> node stage, mortality in the thiamethoxam treatment ranged from 0 (two-plant treatment)
                  to 2 weevils and 1–2 in the controls. Given these low and variable numbers, no statistical
                  analysis was performed for weevil mortality in this test nor could the differences
                  between weevil cohorts be tested since age was confounded by crop stage and the lower
                  insecticide potency expected in older plants at the 5
                  <sup>th</sup> node stage.
               </p>
               <p>Results from Test 3 agreed with the first two tests with respect to foliage damage
                  by adult weevils. Plants from treated seed suffered significantly less feeding damage
                  by 
                  <i>S. lineatus</i> than control plants. All measures of feeding, including number of notches per stipule,
                  visual ratings of damage (data not shown), area and percentage of stipule consumed
                  (measured by image analysis), and number of fecal spots on filter paper, were significantly
                  higher for the control treatment than the thiamethoxam treatment for about 14 days
                  of feeding (
                  <a href="#t03_01">Table 3</a>) and 2–3 times higher during the first 10 days. The subsample subjected to image
                  analysis further demonstrated quantitatively the effect of thiamethoxam on stipule
                  consumption (
                  <a href="#f02_01">Figure 2</a>). Differences were larger and statistically significant at the 2
                  <sup>nd</sup> node stage, when weevils consumed about 65 mm
                  <sup>2</sup> of untreated foliage, which equaled almost 11% of the area, in contrast to 16 mm
                  <sup>2</sup> of foliage from thiamethoxam treated seed which represented only about 3% of the
                  area. At the 4
                  <sup>th</sup> node stage, the amount fed was 19–25 mm
                  <sup>2</sup> in the thiamethoxam and untreated foliage and did not differ statistically and represented
                  only 36% of the stipule area.

                  period of 11 days, whereas those fed control foliage had a pre-oviposition period
                  of only four days. The average cumulative number of eggs laid per female during the

            <p>In the Canadian prairies of southern Alberta and southern Saskatchewan, 
               <i>S. lineatus</i> has emerged as a new and potentially important pest of field peas (
               <a href="#bibr19">Vankosky et al. 2009</a>), and several thousands of hectares have been sprayed since 2006 in years when adult
               weevil damage to seedlings has been high. In 2007, the seed-treatment thiamethoxam
               was registered on an emergency basis with the support of foliage-damage reduction
               data collected from other jurisdictions (T. Labun, Syngenta Canada Inc; personal communication
               with H. Cárcamo) and has since received permanent registration. However, prior to
               this study, it was not known what specific effects thiamethoxam had on egg, larval,
               and adult mortality.
            </p>
            <p>The first test confirmed that the registered rate of thiamethoxam of 30 g a.i. per
               100 kg of seed (∼ 82 g. of a.i./ha at the recommended seeding rate of 275 kg/ha as
               per Government of Saskatchewan Agriculture Knowledge, 
               <a href="http://www.agriculture.gov.sk.ca/">http://www.agriculture.gov.sk.ca/</a>) had the lowest levels of feeding damage to stipules and was similar to the 50 g
               dose. These results are similar to those reported by Seidenglanz's et al. (
               <a href="#bibr15">2010</a>) field study in the Czech Republic, who found no consistent differences in 
               <i>S. lineatus</i> notching to unfolded pea stipules between a low dose (87.5 g of a.i./ha), equivalent
               to the registered rate in Canada, and a dose that was two-fold higher. The results
               of the present study also showed that using a lower rate would not result in a reduction
               of damage that differed from the untreated plants. The registered rate was effective
               at reducing foliage feeding by both reproductive and non-reproductive weevils.
            </p>
            <p>The effect of thiamethoxam on feedingdamage reduction covers the duration of the crop
               stage considered vulnerable (2
               <sup>nd</sup>–5
               <sup>th</sup> node). However, large differences in numbers of notches per plant in the range of
               2–3-fold were only observed up to the 3
               <sup>rd</sup>–4
               <sup>th</sup> node stage. This was confirmed by the more quantitative image analysis study, where
               small, non-significant, numerical daily reduction of 6 mm
               <sup>2</sup> of treated and untreated foliage consumed by a pair of weevils at the 5
               <sup>th</sup> node stage was found, in contrast to the 2
               <sup>nd</sup> node stage. In a field study in southern Alberta, Canada, Vankosky et al. (
               <a href="#bibr18">2011</a>) observed consistent reductions of foliage feeding by thiamethoxam up to the 5
               <sup>th</sup> node stage and, in one of the three years, up to the 8
               <sup>th</sup> node.
            </p>
            <p>Mortality of adult weevils was consistently low in all the trials. All of the tests
               demonstrated that only 15–30% of adults that fed on pea foliage from thiamethoxam
               treated seeds (30 g/100 kg) actually died. Also, in contrast to reports on Elateridae
               where most are only intoxicated (
               <a href="#bibr17">Van Herk et al. 2008</a>), this phenomenon seems to occur only in 15% of the knocked out weevils, and the
               remaining die. Mortality also occurred over a long period; 50% or more of the weevils
               took over a week to die. No previous studies have reported mortality of 
               <i>Sitona</i> weevils to thiamethoxam, but a study on the carrot root weevil, 
               <i>Listronotus oregonensis</i>, found lower yields of carrots with this seed-treatment compared to fipronil (
               <a href="#bibr04">Bonham et al. 2009</a>), suggesting inconsistent control by the former compound. In a study of corn rootworm,
               
               <i>Diabrotica virgifera virgifera</i> Le Conte, Cox et al. (2007) found acceptable levels of yield protection with seed-treatments
               of thiamethoxam, similar to those reported in cereals with wireworms (
               <a href="#bibr20">Vernon et al. 2009</a>). However, it is not known if rootworm s are actually being killed or simply intoxicated
               as is the case with wireworms (
               <a href="#bibr17">Van Herk et al.
                  2008
               </a>). Similar inconsistent results were reported for 
               <i>Aphis glycines</i> Matsumura in soybeans by Ohnesorg et al. (
               <a href="#bibr19">2009</a>). In contrast, the potato leafhopper, 
               <i>Empoasca fabae</i> Harris, is more susceptible to thiamethoxam, as shown by their significant reductions
               in density and plant-damage to snap bean grown from treated seed (
               <a href="#bibr12">Nault et al. 2004</a>). It appears that neonicotinoid seedtreatments have selective, insect-killing properties,
               which may be a consideration in terms of conservation of natural enemies as pointed
               out by Ohnesorg et al. (2009), but sub-lethal effects on fitness need to be considered
               as well.
            </p>
            <p>Over the 41 days in the oviposition study, a large reduction (67%) in reproductive
               potential of 
               <i>S. lineatus</i> when fed pea foliage from plants treated with thiamethoxam was noted. This reduction
               was attributed to an increase of the pre-oviposition period by seven days, followed
               by a lower rate of egg laying throughout the study. In fact, over the first 20 days
               of the study, when plants were more vulnerable to pest damage, the reduction was 92%
               and may have had a positive effect on yield protection, depending on field populations
               and environmental conditions. The only published study assessing effects of thiamethoxam
               on pea yield in relation to 
               <i>S. lineatus</i> feeding reported no effects on yield probably because nodule damage by larvae in
               that study ranged from 50–80% despite treatment with thiamethoxam (Vankosky et al.
               2010). In an unpublished study assessing several insecticides in southern Alberta
               (Meers, unpublished data), thiamethoxam and other seed treatments appeared to improve
               yield relative to foliar compounds or controls, but field results seem inconsistent.
            </p>
            <p>Sub-lethal effects of insecticides on arthropods, including fecundity and behavior,
               have been noted elsewhere (Croft and Brown 1975; 
               <a href="#bibr06">Echegaray et al. 2008</a>), including some studies on the relatively newer neonicotinoid class. For example,
               sublethal doses of Acetamiprid, but not thiamethoxam, affected honeybee behavior (El
               Hassani et al. 2007). Imidacloprid has been shown to increase the fecundity of 
               <i>Tetranychus urticae</i> Koch under laboratory assays (James and Price 2002) and may explain the increase
               in populations of this pest when this insecticide is sprayed against psyllids on pears
               (Beer and Himmel 2002). In another study, thiamethoxam and other neonicotinoids at
               field-relevant doses reduced both survivorship of 
               <i>T. urticae</i> and fecundity, though only very slightly relative to controls (
               <a href="#bibr02">Ado et al. 2004</a>); sub-lethal doses had no effects. Effects of pesticides on life history characteristics
               of pests and beneficial arthropods are complex and should be researched in more systems.
            </p>
            <p>
               <i>S. lineatus</i> larva suffered higher mortality than the adults in relation to thiamethoxam in the
               present study, but only ∼5 larvae survived per pot, which seemed low relative to the
               40 eggs added at the start, but consistent with other investigations (
               <a href="#bibr10">Lee and Upton 1992</a>). Crop stage was clearly an important determinant of larval survivorship and subsequent
               effects on nodule damage. A reduction in larval numbers and damage to nodules as well
               as an increase in the number of more complex (tumescent) nodules in relation to thiamethoxam
               treatment was only observed in the plants that received the eggs at the 2
               <sup>nd</sup> node stage in contrast to those that received them at the 5
               <sup>th</sup> node. This finding is important because it shows that growers should not need to
               take control action for early seeded crops when the weevils arrive past the 5
               <sup>th</sup> node. This is the first study to present data on 
               <i>S. lineatus</i> larval mortality in relation to thiamethoxam, which suggests activity of the chemical
               in the nodules; Seidenglanz et al. (
               <a href="#bibr15">2010</a>) also reported an effect on larval mortality but neglected to present the data.
            </p>
            <p>Effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on enhanced nodulation of peas or seedling vigor
               in general have been noted in other studies. Seidenglanz et al. (
               <a href="#bibr15">2010</a>) reported an increase in total nodulation in the range of 43–363% from a number of
               compounds that included thiamethoxam, imidacloprid, and chothianidin. More modest
               nodulation increases (30–100%) in relation to thiamethoxam were reported by Vankosky
               et al. (
               <a href="#bibr18">2011</a>). The mechanism for this effect is unknown, but some have speculated that thiamethoxam
               may stimulate greater formation of fine root hairs, which may harbor more 
               <i>Rhizobium</i> bacteria (
               <a href="#bibr18">Vankosky et al. 2011</a>). Higher root biomass has also been noted in crops such as canola in relation to
               neonicotinoid seed treatment (Tansey et al 2008). Increases in nodulation, however,
               may not translate to yield protection. In the study by Vankosky et al (
               <a href="#bibr18">2011</a>), there was no effect of seed treatment on yield, which may be explained by incomplete
               control of the weevil or alternatively by lack of strong effects of the weevil on
               plant yield. In the study by Seidenglanz (
               <a href="#bibr15">2010</a>), yields were not reported, but damaged nodules were not affected by treatments or
               were higher in the plots with thiamethoxam or another seed-treatment compared to the
               controls.
            </p>
            <p>In conclusion, the present greenhouse and laboratory studies have elucidated the mechanism
               of the effect of thiamethoxam on 
               <i>S. lineatus</i>; a small proportion of the adults (15–30%) are knocked down and the majority of these
               die (85%). The remaining weevils will lay substantially fewer eggs. Of the larvae
               that hatch and find nodules, only 30% are expected to survive in the thiamethoxam
               treated plants, provided the adults arrived and laid eggs during the early growth
               stages (2
               <sup>nd</sup> node). The present study did not investigate effects on yield, but published and
               unpublished reports suggest inconsistent effects of thiamethoxam on yield protection.
               Seed treatments should be integrated with non-chemical strategies such as biological
               control or agronomic control to improve management of this pest.
