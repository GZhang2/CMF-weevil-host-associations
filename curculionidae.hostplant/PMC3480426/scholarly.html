               <p>Alien insects are increasingly being dispersed around the world through international
                  trade, causing a multitude of negative environmental impacts and billions of dollars
                  in economic losses annually. Border controls form the last line of defense against
                  invasions, whereby inspectors aim to intercept and stop consignments that are contaminated
                  with harmful alien insects. In Europe, member states depend on one another to prevent
                  insect introductions by operating a first point of entry rule – controlling goods
                  only when they initially enter the continent. However, ensuring consistency between
                  border control points is difficult because there exists no optimal inspection strategy.
                  For the first time, we developed a method to quantify the volume of agricultural trade
                  that should be inspected for quarantine insects at border control points in Europe,
                  based on global agricultural trade of over 100 million distinct origin-commodity-species-destination
                  pathways. This metric was then used to evaluate the performance of existing border
                  controls, as measured by border interception results in Europe between 2003 and 2007.
                  Alarmingly, we found significant gaps between the trade pathways that should be inspected
                  and actual number of interceptions. Moreover, many of the most likely introduction
                  pathways yielded none or very few insect interceptions, because regular interceptions
                  are only made on only a narrow range of pathways. European countries with gaps in
                  border controls have been invaded by higher numbers of quarantine alien insect species,
                  indicating the importance of proper inspections to prevent insect invasions. Equipped
                  with an optimal inspection strategy based on the underlying risks of trade, authorities
                  globally will be able to implement more effective and consistent border controls.

            <p>Invasive alien insects are being unintentionally moved around the world at unprecedented
               rates 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Roques1">[1]</a> as contaminants of international trade 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Drake1">[2]</a>–
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Pyek1">[4]</a>, impacting on ecosystems, agriculture, forestry and human health, resulting in billions
               of dollars in economic losses annually 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Pimentel1">[5]</a>–
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Vil1">[7]</a>. Europe has already been invaded by over 1,000 insect species, including some of
               the most invasive insects such as the Tobacco Whitefly (
               <i>Bemisia tabaci)</i>, the Western Corn Rootworm (
               <i>Diabrotica virgifera</i>) and the Colorado Potato Beetle (
               <i>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</i>) 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Roques2">[8]</a>. With ever-increasing international trade, both the number of invasions and the scale
               of their impacts are expected to increase 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Levine1">[9]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Essl1">[10]</a>.
            </p>
            <p>The international response to invasions has been driven by agreements such as the
               World Trade Organization Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary
               Measures (SPS), the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) of the Food and
               Agricultural Organization of the United Nations and the Convention for Biological
               Diversity (CBD), with a strategic focus on prevention as the most cost-effective management
               method 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Puth1">[11]</a>–
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Hulme1">[13]</a>. For example, the IPPC has developed a list of International Standards and Phytosanitary
               Measures (ISPM’s), which set out rules and recommendations for all aspects of the
               trade process, 
               <i>e.g</i>. ISPM 15 “Guidelines for regulating wood packaging in international trade” which
               are aimed at reducing the likelihood of insect dispersal. However, there are gaps
               in international regulatory frameworks for the management of unintentional species
               movements, which includes the majority of invasive insects, because of the difficulties
               in evaluating the efficacy of prevention measures 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Hulme2">[14]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Hulme3">[15]</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Only plant-pest insect species are regulated in Europe. Economically harmful insects
               are “black-listed” and banned from entering and being moved around the continent (European
               Council Directive 2000/29/EC on protective measures against the introduction into
               the community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread
               within the community). As a last line of defense against invasions from regulated
               insects, incoming consignments are controlled through phytosanitary inspections at
               Europe’s borders. Interceptions of quarantine species are entered into EPPO’s central
               communication database (European Council Directive 2000/29/EC). Under current legislation
               inspectors must check all consignments that could contain quarantine insects. Inspectors
               carry out inspections armed with knowledge of the Europhyt database results, together
               with general taxonomic and distribution data about the quarantine insects. Whilst
               inspectors must check all consignments that could contain quarantine insects according
               to the European Council Directive, exact sampling volumes and methods can vary between
               European member states because no optimal inspection strategy exists 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Surkov1">[16]</a>. Moreover, making decisions regarding sampling volumes is becoming more difficult
               because of increasing international trade whereby inspectors only have the capacity
               to sample a small fraction of total imports 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Surkov1">[16]</a>–
               <a href="#pone.0047689-NationalResearchCounciloftheUnited1">[18]</a>. For example of scale, only 2% of all border crossing cargo arriving at maritime
               ports, airports and land crossings into the US is inspected 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Work1">[19]</a>. Because Europe operates a “first point of entry rule”, this can lead to border control
               inconsistencies regarding border inspections. Indeed member states depend on the border
               control efficacy of one another, as phytosanitary inspectors control goods only when
               they initially enter the continent.
            </p>
            <p>A further concern is that there exists no method to evaluate the performance of existing
               border controls 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Hulme2">[14]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Hulme3">[15]</a>, mainly because pathway management 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Puth1">[11]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Kolar1">[20]</a>, invasions of insects as a taxonomic group 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Pyek2">[21]</a> and optimal detection strategies 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Surkov1">[16]</a> have been understudied in invasion biology. Hence, thus far, border controls have
               only been analyzed on a stand-alone basis using interception data 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Roques3">[22]</a>–
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Kenis2">[24]</a>. There is therefore a danger that inconsistencies between the border control points
               of Europe exist, leaving Europe highly exposed to quarantine alien insect invasions.
               The European Union acknowledges that a more coordinated response to insect invasions
               is required by its member states 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Hulme2">[14]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Hulme3">[15]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Wilson1">[25]</a>, with the need for pathway risk management to support risk assessment 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Hulme3">[15]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Baker1">[26]</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Variables such as the volume and identity of goods traded, their origin and destination,
               can be integrated with aspects of insect biology to estimate the likelihood of unintentional
               insect introductions through trade 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Hulme3">[15]</a>. Such data has been used to analyze global invasion patterns, regarding the importance
               of transport hubs 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Floerl1">[27]</a> and the role of the worldwide airline network combined with climatic similarity 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Tatem1">[28]</a> in the dispersal of alien disease vector species. Although more specific case studies
               have been undertaken, such as determining the dispersal risk of forest insects with
               specific trade pathways 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Skarpass1">[29]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Yemshanov1">[30]</a> and imports of Chrysanthemum (
               <i>Dendranthema grandiflora</i>) cuttings by the Netherlands 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Surkov1">[16]</a>, a general analysis of Europe’s border controls against insect introductions is lacking.
            </p>
            <p>We developed for the first time, a method to quantify the volume of trade that is
               subject to inspection in Europe, 
               <i>Trade Volume to be inspected (TV),</i> and measured the performance of border inspections by relating TV to the actual number
               of insect interceptions; the 
               <i>Trade Volume to be inspected Per Interception (TVPI)</i>. We expected that TV would be positively correlated to the number of insect interceptions,
               else inspection biases exist, which lead to gaps in border controls. Furthermore,
               we hypothesized that European countries with the weakest border controls, measured
               by the highest TVPI (
               <i>i.e.</i> the lowest frequency of interceptions per TV) are likely to have the highest levels
               of alien insect invasions.

               <p>We developed a general method to quantify the volume of agricultural trade; a major
                  invasion pathway into Europe 
                  <a href="#pone.0047689-Roques3">[22]</a>, 
                  <a href="#pone.0047689-Kenis2">[24]</a>, that is subject to phytosanitary controls. Trade pathways consist of many components
                  
                  <a href="#pone.0047689-Hulme3">[15]</a>, of which we considered four; country of origin 
                  <i>o</i>, agricultural commodity being traded 
                  <i>c</i>, quarantine insect species 
                  <i>i</i>, and European destination country 
                  <i>d</i>, so that each pathway 
                  <i>o-c-i-d</i> can be uniquely represented. We included all quarantine insect species in Europe
                  (
                  <i>i</i> = 200 insect species) in our analysis, compiling their global distribution, agricultural
                  host plants, and border interception data, together with traded value (US$) in agricultural
                  commodities listed by the FAO (
                  <i>c</i> = 126 commodity types) between origins (
                  <i>o</i> = 167 origin countries) and European destinations (
                  <i>d = 28</i> countries), totaling 117,835,200 distinct

                  <i>i</i>-
                  <i>d</i> pathways (
                  <a href="#pone.0047689.s002">Tables S1</a>, 
                  <a href="#pone.0047689.s003">S2</a>,

                  <a href="#pone.0047689.s008">S7</a>).
               </p>
               <p>We defined the 
                  <i>Trade Volume to be inspected (TV)</i> by importing European country 
                  <i>d</i> when importing commodity 
                  <i>c</i> from origin country 
                  <i>o</i>, as the value of trade in commodity 
                  <i>c</i> (in US$), if 
                  <i>both</i> insect species 
                  <i>i</i> exists in origin country 
                  <i>o</i> and commodity 
                  <i>c</i> is a host. Therefore, if either insect 
                  <i>i</i> does not exist in origin 
                  <i>o</i>, or commodity 
                  <i>c</i> is not a potential host, then the TV of that 
                  <i>o-c-i-d</i> trade is zero. Thus TV is only positive on pathways that could potentially move quarantine
                  insects through trade. For example, if a European country is importing maize from
                  Argentina, then the TV of the Western Corn Rootworm (
                  <i>Diabrotica virgifera</i>) moving on this pathway is zero because, despite maize being its primary host, the
                  insect species does not exist in Argentina. Alternatively, the TV of the Western Corn
                  Rootworm arriving into Europe from North America on mangos is also zero, because despite
                  North America being within its distribution range, mango is not a host for any part
                  of the Western Corn Rootworm’s life cycle. Therefore, rather than just using total
                  trade volumes to relate to invasions 
                  <a href="#pone.0047689-Roques1">[1]</a>, which take no account of insect species distributions or biology, TV is a more accurate
                  approximation of the import volumes that Europe’s phytosanitary inspectors must check.
               </p>
               <p>TV can be aggregated through the summation of the individual 
                  <i>o-c-i-d</i> pathways, and thus TV represents the trade volume to be inspected, weighted by the
                  number of quarantine insect species that can be dispersed by that pathway. For example,
                  summing TV across all pathways with origin 
                  <i>o</i> = USA enables us to quantify the total TV of all agricultural trade, weighted across
                  all quarantine insect species, into all European countries, originating from the USA.
                  Repeating this for all exporting countries allows us to compare the TV between world
                  origins, and similarly, between commodities, insect species and European countries.
               </p>
               <p>The performance of border controls should be measured by their output – the number
                  of insect interceptions. We would expect that trade pathways with a higher TV would
                  yield a higher number of insect interceptions, because phytosanitary inspectors should
                  target those pathways that carry a higher insect contamination risk, otherwise there
                  could be biases in controls. For example, a European country with a high TV (
                  <i>i.e.</i> a large importer of agricultural goods, of which many could potentially be contaminated
                  by quarantine insects) has a high level of exposure to alien insect arrivals, and
                  hence should be expected to intercept more quarantine insects than a country with
                  low TV. Hence, to evaluate the performance of border controls, we calculated the 
                  <i>Trade Volume to be inspected Per Interception (TVPI)</i>, calculated as the TV divided by the number of insect interceptions made on that
                  
                  <i>o-c-i-d</i> pathway, and interpreted as the volume of trade to be imported per insect interception
                  made (
                  <i>i.e</i>. the reciprocal of the interception rate per TV). High levels of TVPI indicate pathways
                  with weak border controls (low interception rate) because few insect interceptions
                  are made in relation to trade volumes that could be carrying quarantine insects, the
                  TV. TVPI can thus be interpreted as a measure of the number of insects passing through
                  border controls, or the propagule pressure. For example, the Netherlands has a TVPI = $54,623,
                  hence they make a quarantine insect interception per $54,623 of TV, whereas Italy
                  only makes one interception per $3,074,660 of TV (
                  <i>i.e</i>. Italy intercepts insects far less frequently, per TV, than the Netherlands). Hence,
                  the metric TVPI can be used to identify those pathways in Europe that yield too few
                  insect interceptions, and require further and immediate attention by biosecurity management
                  authorities.
               </p>
               <p>We explore some of the factors that could explain variations in TVPI such as country
                  wealth (
                  <i>e.g.</i> rich countries can afford to invest more in border controls) and taxonomic differences
                  between insect families and plant order (
                  <i>e.g.</i> some insect families are easier to detect and thus more often looked for) which could
                  influence the likelihood of insect contaminations being detected. Note that there
                  are many other factors that potentially influence TVPI, such as the role of packaging,
                  that we do not consider in this study.
               </p>
               <p>We hypothesized that TVPI rather than TV should be related to the level of insect
                  invasions in Europe, if border controls play a significant preventative role, because
                  TVPI can be considered as a proxy for the propagule pressure – the number of individuals
                  of an alien species that are introduced to the invaded region 
                  <a href="#pone.0047689-Colautti1">[31]</a>, which is generally a key determinant of invasion success 
                  <a href="#pone.0047689-Lockwood1">[32]</a>. The role of TV and TVPI within the insect dispersal process are illustrated in

                        <p>We defined the 
                           <i>Trade Volume to be inspected (TV)</i> to importing European country 
                           <i>d</i> when importing commodity

                           <i>o</i>, as the value of trade in commodity 
                           <i>c</i> (in US$), if 
                           <i>both</i> insect species 
                           <i>i</i> exists in origin country

                           <i>c</i> is a host. Therefore, if either insect 
                           <i>i</i> does not exist in origin 
                           <i>o</i>, or commodity 
                           <i>c</i> is not a potential host, then the TV of that 
                           <i>o-c-i-d</i> trade is equal to zero. Thus TV is only positive on pathways that could potentially
                           move quarantine insects through trade, and should be interpreted as a measure of the
                           likelihood of alien insects moving through trade. We calculated the 
                           <i>Trade Volume to be inspected Per Interception (TVPI)</i> as the TV divided by the number of interceptions made per origin 
                           <i>o</i>, commodity 
                           <i>c</i>, insect species

                           <i>d</i>. Other factors which affect the likelihood of insect dispersal, such as pre-export
                           controls, were not included in this study since all exporters must fulfill the International
                           Plant protection Convention (IPPC) standards and regulation. TVPI and TV do not measure
                           other factors that determine establishment success, such as climate, host-plant availability
                           and ecological processes.

               <p>We included all quarantine alien insect species listed by the EU Directive (European
                  Council Directive 2000/29/EC) and the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection
                  Organization (EPPO) as of the end of December 2010, which totalled 200 species (
                  <a href="#pone.0047689.s007">Table S6</a>). Many species featured in both lists, so we used an AND/OR approach to combine the
                  lists. All of these insects pose a serious threat for agriculture in Europe or could
                  do so once they enter the continent and thus they are banned from entering and being
                  moved around (European Council Directive 2000/29/EC). For each insect species, we
                  compiled country-level data for their worldwide ranges (EPPO, Centre for Agriculture
                  and Biosciences International (CABI) Crop Compendium, and Delivering Alien Invasive
                  Species Inventories for Europe (DAISIE, 
                  <a href="http://www.europe-aliens.org">www.europe-aliens.org</a>)). In total, 167 non-European countries were included. Inconsistencies between the
                  datasets were resolved using an AND/OR approach, so that the distribution ranges we
                  used represented a maximal potential range. European countries that have eradicated
                  a quarantine species were not included in the distribution ranges of such species.
                  World agricultural trade data was obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization
                  (FAO), and we recorded import values in US$ for specific commodities originating from
                  non-European countries, into all 28 EPPO-reporting European countries (
                  <a href="#pone.0047689.s003">Table S2</a>). We included the latest available data, and averaged over the 5-year period between
                  2003 and 2007. We used US$ values in trade rather than weight in kg (which yielded
                  largely the same results), for comparability of commodities that are traded in vastly
                  different volumes. The FAO database includes a total of 548 agricultural commodity
                  products. However, we only considered those commodity fields that are traded in natural,
                  unprocessed and unmanufactured form, totalling 126 commodities in this study (
                  <a href="#pone.0047689.s006">Table S5</a>). This included even those agricultural commodities that are not mass-produced in
                  Europe, but that could nevertheless be host to at least one quarantine insect species.
                  For example, bananas have a high TV in Europe because they can host several quarantine
                  insects such as 
                  <i>Unaspis citri</i> and 
                  <i>Aleurocanthus woglumi,</i> which are polyphagous feeders and could be serious pests of 
                  <i>e.g</i>. citrus fruits in Europe.
               </p>
               <p>We extracted border insect interception data from EPPO (Reporting Service) between
                  2003 and 2007, for each of the 200 quarantine-listed insect species. By law, European
                  countries are required to report all interceptions of quarantine insects (European
                  Council Directive 2000/29/EC). We recorded only those interceptions made on agricultural
                  commodities listed in the FAO trade database, which meant excluding interceptions
                  on “Cut flowers and branches” (2,038 interceptions) and on basil 
                  <i>Ocimum basilicum</i> (1,924 interceptions). Furthermore, we only considered interceptions of the 200 quarantine-listed
                  species, so that each interception could be assigned to a unique 
                  <i>o-c-i-d</i> pathway. Therefore, we also excluded incomplete interception records such as “Non-European
                  Tephritidae” (1,055 interceptions). However, the “Non-European Tephritidae” interceptions
                  consisted primarily of interceptions made on mangos (424 interceptions) and from Thailand
                  (460 interceptions) which if included, only strengthened our results - that interceptions
                  on these pathway are highly numerous compared to other pathways which pose similar
                  and higher risks. In total we included 1,148 interception records in this study, which
                  could each be assigned to a unique 
                  <i>o-c-i-d</i> pathway, and accurately reflect the number of complete interception records made
                  on agricultural imports in Europe.
               </p>
               <p>In parallel, we compiled a database of host plant ranges for each of the quarantine
                  insect species, aligned to commodities in our FAO commodity list, by combining data
                  from EPPO and CABI on an AND/OR basis (
                  <a href="#pone.0047689.s002">Table S1</a>). For some insect species, host-plant ranges were reduced after taking into account
                  biological factors that limited their ability to be dispersed through trade. For example,
                  the Hemipteran bugs 
                  <i>Margarodes prieskaensis, M. vitis</i> and 
                  <i>M. vredendalensis</i>, are associated with the common grape (
                  <i>Vitis vinifera</i>) but grapes were not included as potential dispersal hosts because these insect species
                  are sessile on plant roots in the soil and are very unlikely to be dispersed by fruit
                  trade (EPPO data sheets on Quarantine Pests). In general, root-feeding insects such
                  as Coleopteran species in the families Scarabaeidae and Chrysomelidae were included
                  in fruit and vegetable trade since they have previously been intercepted on vegetables
                  (EPPO data sheets on Quarantine Pests). Potato plants such as 
                  <i>Solanum tuberosum</i> are potential hosts for many of the quarantine species, however few are associated
                  with the actual potato tubers which are usually moved in trade. Therefore, potato
                  tubers were not considered as potential dispersal hosts for the following potato foliage-feeding
                  insects; 
                  <i>Bemisia tabaci</i>, 
                  <i>Helicoverpa sp., Thrips palmi, Liriomyza sp</i>., 
                  <i>Spodoptera sp., Cacoecimorpha pronubana</i>, and 
                  <i>Tuta absoluta</i> (EPPO data sheets on Quarantine Pests).
               </p>
               <p>Nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was used as a measure of a country’s economic
                  wealth. GDP data at current prices in US$ were obtained from the International Monetary
                  Fund (IMF) and averaged from 2003–2007. We also tested European interception data
                  against the importance of agriculture in GDP, hypothesizing that countries with important
                  agricultural sectors care more about preventative border controls. We gathered importance
                  of agriculture as a percentage of GDP from the World Factbook Central Intelligence
                  Agency 2010 (CIA).

                  <i>r</i> to test for relationships between variables such as TV, the number of interceptions
                  and TVPI. A generalised linear model was used to test for the effects of TVPI on the
                  level of invasion in Europe, correcting for the confounding effects of climate (latitude
                  of capital city), climatic heterogeneity (altitudinal difference between lowest and
                  highest point), and country area (

                  taken as dependent variable, and latitude, altitudinal difference, country area, and
                  country TVPI were used as independent variables, all scaled to zero mean and one standard
                  deviation

                  a Poisson distribution of the dependent variable. We checked model assumptions by
                  calculating the dispersion parameter (residual deviance/degrees of freedom), which

               and African countries dominated the interception database (73% of interceptions) despite

               <i>Helicoverpa armigera)</i>, the Eggplant Borer (
               <i>Leucinodes orbonalis)</i> and the Tobacco Whitefly (
               <i>Bemisia tabaci)</i>, despite the broad spectrum of TV (
               <a href="#pone-0047689-g002">Figs. 2B &amp; 2C</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0047689.s006">Tables S5</a>–
               <a href="#pone.0047689.s007">S6</a>). Moreover, the vast majority of commodities (76%) and quarantine insect species
               (81%) yielded zero interceptions. Taxonomy was tested as an explanation of plant commodity
               and insect species control bias, to account for factors affecting inspection efficacy,
               such as variations in physical properties between commodities and life history traits
               of quarantine insects. However, we found good correlations between the number of interceptions
               and TV aggregated by plant order (r = 0.58, n = 21, p = 0.006) and insect family (r = 0.58,
               n = 31, p = 0.001), indicating that interceptions were not biased according to particular
               taxonomic groups. By contrast, we found interception bias between insect species and
               plant commodities within taxonomic groups. Bias exists within 6 out of 7 plant orders
               – Asparagales (r = 0.18, n = 6, p = 0.730), Ericales (r = 0.18, n = 7, p = 0.700),
               Fabales (r = −0.07, n = 14, p = 0.810), Rosales (r = −0.04, n = 15, p = 0.89), Sapindales
               (r = 0.19, n = 8, p = 0.650) and Solanales (r = 0.22, n = 7, p = 0.640), and within
               all insect families with n&gt;5– Curculionidae (r = −0.10, n = 21, p = 0.670), Noctuidae
               (r = −0.15, n = 7, p = 0.750), Tephritidae (r = 0.11, n = 36, p = 0.520) and Tortricidae
               (r = −0.11, n = 11, p = 0.750).
            </p>
            <p>Overall, we found that the insect species with the highest TVPI are the Northern Corn
               Rootworm (
               <i>Diabrotica barberi)</i>, the Citrus Blackfly (
               <i>Aleurocanthus woglumi</i>) and the Pink Mealybug (
               <i>Maconellicoccus hirsutus</i>). These are the insect species for which the highest trade volume (TV) needs to arrive
               per interception, assuming current practice, thus these are the species that are most
               likely to slip past border controls. The most likely pathways of entry measured by
               TVPI are on agricultural imports from the Americas, especially from both the U.S.A.
               and Brazil, and on commodities such as soybeans, tobacco, coffee, bananas and wheat
               (

            <p>We also analyzed the border controls of European countries and found that alien insects
               are intercepted in proportion to TV (r = 0.73, n = 28, p = 0.00001) (
               <a href="#pone-0047689-g002">Fig. 2D</a>). However, high TVPI pathways exist because the majority of member states (17 out
               of 28) recorded not a single insect interception, despite all having some level of
               TV (

               the capacity of European countries to implement border controls (countries’ wealth
               estimated by GDP) (r = 0.21, n = 28, p = 0.280) and the importance of agriculture
               (as a % of GDP) (r = −0.21, n = 28, p = 0.280).

               for alien insect invasions (low latitude, high altitudinal ranges) – Portugal, Switzerland,
               Italy and Greece, also have the highest TVPI because of weak border controls (

            <p>Europe is highly exposed to insect introductions through agricultural trade, with
               control gaps, indicated by high TVPI, existing across a wide range of pathways. Inconsistencies
               were not surprising given the absence of an optimisation strategy on which border
               control authorities should base sampling efforts. Although control bias between pathways
               could not be explained, they are difficult to justify because all types of agricultural
               commodities from all country origins are regulated for all quarantine-listed insects
               under the IPPC, and phytosanitary certificates are required to confirm that international
               standards have been reached (IPPC; European Council Directive 2000/29/EC).
            </p>
            <p>Preventative border controls therefore have a key role to play, especially since 145
               out of 200 quarantine-listed species have not yet established in Europe (
               <a href="#pone.0047689.s004">Table S3</a>). Moreover, TVPI was significantly related to the number of insect invasions, even
               though only a small proportion of total incoming goods are likely to be inspected
               
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Work1">[19]</a>. Hence, phytosanitary inspections likely reduce the propagule pressure by acting
               as a deterrent for exporting contaminated goods.
            </p>
            <p>In particular, the Americas were under-represented in Europe’s interception databases
               according to TVPI. This is worrying because the Americas are known to be a major source
               of insect invasions, contributing 33% of all insect species invasions in Europe to
               date (Roques 
               <i>et al.</i> 2010). Furthermore, a study of cargo aircraft from Central America showed that 23%
               of flights were infested with live hitchhiking insects 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Dobbs1">[36]</a>. Insect invasions of American origin include some of the worst pests (DAISIE), such
               as the Western Corn Rootworm (
               <i>Diabrotica virgifera)</i>, which is associated with trade from North America 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Miller1">[37]</a> and has a European distribution centered around international transport hubs (EPPO).
               Such transport hubs are stepping stones for invasions, being both more likely to be
               invaded and therefore likely to enhance the further spread of invasions to secondary
               locations 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Floerl1">[27]</a>. Hence with free intra-European trade, quarantine species that enter Europe at major
               transport hubs such as international airports and maritime ports, pose significant
               invasion risks to the rest of Europe. For example, we identified the Northern Corn
               Rootworm (
               <i>Diabrotica barberi)</i>, a close relative of the Western Corn Rootworm, as one of the most likely European
               arrivals under existing control practices (
               <a href="#pone-0047689-g002">Fig. 2C</a>), with a high TV, but no reported interceptions. Although GDP was not found to significantly
               explain the country of origin control bias, it is likely that the perception of risk
               and political relationships (
               <i>e.g.</i> historical relationships, trade agreements and trust) plays some role in inspection
               sampling efforts.
            </p>
            <p>Commodities that are imported on a large-scale, such as soybeans, tobacco, coffee,
               bananas and wheat (
               <a href="#pone-0047689-g002">Fig. 2B</a>), and their quarantine insect associates, represent the highest TVPI in Europe. Taxonomic
               differences between commodities and insects did not explain the control biases, but
               other practical and physical limitations may influence control efficacy. For example,
               adequately inspecting large-volume shipments of commodities such as soybeans, for
               endophytic insects, poses significant logistical challenges to inspectors because
               of both difficulties of scale and the hidden nature of many insect contaminations.
               Furthermore, the state in which import commodities arrive in Europe, such as the level
               by which they have been part-processed and the accessibility of different packaging
               types, are all likely to influence inspection efficacy. In other studies about the
               role of transport in facilitating insect dispersal, a wide range of commodity pathways
               and a broad spectrum of insect species have been recorded 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-McCullough1">[23]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Dobbs1">[36]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Liebhold1">[38]</a>, suggesting that Europe’s interception database consists of a too narrow pathway
               focus.
            </p>
            <p>The interception biases we found in Europe might be an indication that inspection
               sampling is influenced by historic interception database records, which are used for
               prioritization in the absence of a general method to quantify the true underlying
               risks. This has a compounding effect – pathways that yield insect interceptions now
               are thus more likely to be targeted by future inspections. In turn, this process narrows
               the number of pathways that are subject to border inspection. This is especially evident
               when considering interceptions by either commodity type or insect species, which are
               both dominated by just 4 types/species (
               <a href="#pone-0047689-g002">Fig. 2B &amp; 2C</a>) and show inspection bias between taxonomically related groups. Interception databases
               should only be used as a guide for inspection sampling if total inspection efforts
               are recorded which would allow the calculation of interception rates 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Roques3">[22]</a>; otherwise we recommend that sampling efforts should be distributed in proportion
               to TV.
            </p>
            <p>Gaps in border controls measured by TVPI, caused by biased interception data not reflecting
               fairly the TV, were shown to significantly correlate to high levels of insect invasions
               in Europe. Biosecurity authorities should be aware that targeting inspections to better
               control pathways with high TVPI could help to prevent insect invasions, and should
               be given immediate attention and further investigation to determine if high TVPI is
               justifiable. Firstly, high TVPI pathways should be tested for bias by obtaining phytosanitary
               inspector sampling effort statistics, rather than just positive interception records
               
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Roques3">[22]</a>. Evidence of low sampling effort can be addressed by increasing inspection effort
               according to TV, or increasing and improving inspection resources 
               <i>i.e.</i> an increase in inspector numbers and training. For pathways with high TVPI despite
               high sampling effort, novel insect detection techniques could be employed at border
               control points to test the efficacy of phytosanitary inspection as a general insect
               detection measure. For example, a series of insect traps aimed at quarantine insect
               species could be installed at major international transport hubs in Europe to complement
               phytosanitary inspections.
            </p>
            <p>However, many invasive insect species that were not previously considered as quarantine
               have established in Europe 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Roques2">[8]</a>. Current border controls only target the quarantine-listed insect species in plant
               protection. Hence using interception data, we can only measure the efficacy of existing
               control measures, in relation to the 200 quarantine species that they were set-up
               to intercept. Therefore, actual gaps in border controls are higher than indicated
               by TVPI because many non-quarantine-listed insects also have invasion potential and
               are not controlled by border authorities. In comparison, the world-leading biosecurity
               authorities of New Zealand 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Requirements1">[39]</a> and Australia 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Australian1">[40]</a> take a more stringent white-list approach to quarantine, whereby border controls
               target the interception of all incoming alien insect species. An important issue for
               European authorities is whether a black-list of known invasive insects, as analysed
               in this study, or broader white-list approach make a more effective border control
               strategy.
            </p>
            <p>Under current Europe-wide legislation, it is crucial that member states maintain coordinated
               and consistent border control strategies. This can be achieved by basing sampling
               efforts according to the underlying TV, reducing biases and hence TVPI which correlates
               to invasion. Optimising sampling efforts 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Surkov1">[16]</a> can reduce the environmental and economic impacts of insect invasions both now 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Pimentel1">[5]</a>–
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Vil1">[7]</a> and in the future 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Essl1">[10]</a>. Social and political complications that arise through applying such measures could
               be overcome if Europe established a central authority to integrate regulation with
               management response 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Hulme1">[13]</a>. TVPI and TV could also be quantified more widely for any set of origins, destinations
               and commodities traded, such as forestry products 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Roques1">[1]</a> and ornamental plants 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Roques3">[22]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0047689-Kenis2">[24]</a>, and adapted to include any insect species list, including disease vectors as well
               as plant pests, to assist the risk assessment of alien insect introductions worldwide.
