Only one species is known from Palaearctic part of India &#x02013; <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Triotemnus scrofa</named-content> Schedl, 1975, from Uttar Pradesh. This species, together with <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Triotemnus pilicornis</named-content> Wood, 1992, occur in Oriental region (India, and <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Triotemnus scrofa</named-content> also in Sri Lanka). Other species of the genus &#x02013; <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Triotemnus aethiopicus</named-content> Eggers, 1936, <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Triotemnus striatus</named-content> Eggers, 1936 and <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Triotemnus villiersi</named-content> Schedl, 1958 live in Afrotropical region. Interestingly, all the species were described in separate publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Balachowsky 1949b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Eggers 1936a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Eggers 1936b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Gatti and Pennacchio 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Peyerimhoff 1919</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Peyerimhoff 1925</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Peyerimhoff 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Schedl 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Schedl 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Wollaston 1864</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Wood 1992</xref>). That fact, as well as the rather scarce literature on species and genus level, reflects the relative rareness of all the species. Some species are also rare in museum collections and are very seldom collected by entomologists. Collecting of these species in the field is apparently difficult, but many specimens can nevertheless be obtained by raring when infested parts of the host plants are collected.<!--PageBreak--></p><p>Even though the fauna and flora of Socotra shows high endemicity, there are in some cases affinities to the Ethiopian and Indian fauna, perhaps due to a common geological history of these areas. Socotran species of <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Triotemnus</named-content> differ distinctly from all other species of the genus. Including the information about their biology, these species are suggested as endemic and the possibility for occurring elsewhere is very unlikely. On the contrary, the new species from Morocco are morphologically very similar to known species from that region. Because of the morphological uniformity, one may suggest that species from this region diversified rather recently, and have had little time for morphological differentiation (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Jordal and Hewitt 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Jordal et al. 2004</xref>, for similar examples). Even though the new species were always collected from just one location, the broader distribution of their host plants makes occurrence in other areas likely (all known species of <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Triotemnus</named-content> are living in &#x0201c;small&#x0201d; shrubs, like <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Euphorbia</named-content> spp. and <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Bupleurum</named-content> spp.). On the other hand makes the geographical conditions, such as deep valleys and the meteorological conditions of high mountains, relatively suitable for long term separation of local populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Newly discovered species were compared to all known species in the genus, except <named-content content-type="taxon-name">Triotemnus ulianai</named-content> Gatti &#x00026; Pennacchio, 2004, which was not available for the study. The significance of morphological differences was affirmed by examining long series of specimens. Descriptions use the terminology from e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Wood 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Wood 1992</xref> and/or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Jordal 2009</xref>. Specimens were collected from their host plants directly in the field, and by rearing in the lab. When possible, the gallery system was also studied by dissecting host plant tissue. Internal characters of the beetles were not studied.<!--PageBreak--></p></sec><sec><title>Descriptions of the new species</title><sec sec-type="taxon-treatment"><title><named-content content-type="taxon-name">                        <named-content content-type="genus">Triotemnus</named-content>

Antennae light brown, antennal funicle 4-segmented, antennal club round, rather strongly flattened, anterior side clearly marked by two weakly recurved sutures on anterior half, basal segment mainly corneous, posterior side without visible sutures. <bold>Pronotum</bold> 1.16 times longer than wide, dark brown to black, sub-oval, widest in posterior half, weekly declivous in front, summit not clearly marked, approximately in the frontal third, lateral margins converging anteriorly, frontal and posterior margins rounded, basal angles rounded, disk shining, rather sparsely punctated by coarse punctures except in a smooth median longitudinal area, interspaces finely shagreened, vestiture of sparse, long, semi-erect, very fine, hair-like setae, becoming slightly longer anteriorly. <bold>Elytra</bold> 1.46 times longer than wide, 1.34 times longer than pronotum, light brown, nearly cylindrical, widest just before declivity, broadly, nearly transversely rounded posteriorly; base of elytra rounded, not armed; scutellum visible, very small, blackish, flush with elytra; elytral striae regularly, finely and sparsely punctate, not impressed, interspaces slightly larger then the diameter of the strial punctures, interstriae very sparsely and less deeply punctated, smooth and finely shagreened; elytral declivity regularly rounded at suture, otherwise flattened in the space between suture and third striae up to the weakly defined lateral edges which are slightly elevated, elytral suture very slightly elevated, declivital disc smooth, shining, finely shagreened, microscopically punctate in continuation of the elytral striae. Elytral vestiture of uniseriate rows of two types, sparse and very long (approximately 1.5 times longer than distance between strial punctures) hair-like erect setae and semi-erect shorter (two thirds of the longer setae) hair-like setae, long setae becoming much longer posteriorly on the declivity. <bold>Legs</bold> light brown. Procoxae very narrowly separated, prosternal process short and sharply pointed; mesocoxae separated by slightly more than double width of scapus, mesoventral process broad and broadly rounded apically; metacoxae separated similarly to mesocoxae. Number of tibial socketed teeth on outer lateral margin varying between the specimens. Protibiae with 4&#x02013;5 socketed teeth, mostly 4, meso- and metatibiae with 5&#x02013;6 socketed teeth, mostly 5.</p></sec><!--PageBreak--><sec sec-type="Male"><title>Male.</title><p><bold>Length</bold> 1.17 mm, 2.54 times longer than wide. <bold>Head</bold> similar to female, but frons very shallowly concave up to the level just above upper level of the eyes, concavity very finely and sparsely punctate, shining, very finely shagreened, excavation separated from vertex by a rounded and not well defined costa, marked on vertex in the middle by short transverse keel, vertex semi-shining, deeply and rather densely punctuate; vestiture of frons of very short and fine semi-erect golden, hair-like setae, these apparently longer near epistoma and on the upper border of the frontal excavation.
