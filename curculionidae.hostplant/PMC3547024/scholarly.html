               <p>The tropical root weevil 
                  <i>Diaprepes abbreviatus</i> is a major pest of multiple crops in the Caribbean Islands and has become a serious
                  constraint to citrus production in the United States. Recent work has identified host
                  and conspecific volatiles that mediate host- and mate-finding by 
                  <i>D. abbreviatus</i>. The interaction of light, color, and odors has not been studied in this species.
                  The responses of male and female 
                  <i>D. abbreviatus</i> to narrow bandwidths of visible light emitted by LEDs offered alone and in combination
                  with olfactory stimuli were studied in a specially-designed multiple choice arena
                  combined with a locomotion compensator. Weevils were more attracted to wavelengths
                  close to green and yellow compared with blue or ultraviolet, but preferred red and
                  darkness over green. Additionally, dim green light was preferred over brighter green.
                  Adult weevils were also attracted to the odor of its citrus host + conspecifics. However,
                  the attractiveness of citrus + conspecific odors disappeared in the presence of a
                  green light. Photic stimulation induced males but not females to increase their speed.
                  In the presence of light emitted by LEDs, turning speed decreased and path straightness
                  increased, indicating that weevils tended to walk less tortuously. 
                  <i>Diaprepes abbreviatus</i> showed a hierarchy between chemo- and photo-taxis in the series of experiments presented
                  herein, where the presence of the green light abolished upwind anemotaxis elicited
                  by the pheromone + host plant odor. Insight into the strong responses to visual stimuli
                  of chemically stimulated insects may be provided when the amount of information supplied
                  by vision and olfaction is compared, as the information transmission capacity of compound
                  eyes is estimated to be several orders of magnitude higher compared with the olfactory
                  system. Subordination of olfactory responses by photic stimuli should be considered
                  in the design of strategies aimed at management of such insects.

            <p>The tropical root weevil 
               <i>Diaprepes abbreviatus</i> (L.1758) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Entiminae) is a generalist phytophagous pest
               that can feed on at least 270 species of plants 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Simpson1">[1]</a>. 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> has been reported as a pest within its presumed native range in Puerto Rico and the
               Caribbean Islands since the late 19
               <sup>th</sup> century, feeding on economically important crops such as guava, coffee, sugarcane,
               lime, corn, sweet potato and cotton 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Lapointe1">[2]</a>. Since its discovery in Florida, USA in 1964, it has spread to Texas and California
               
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Lapointe2">[3]</a>. Now that the weevil is established in California and Louisiana, there is no geographic
               or climatic barrier to its movement south to Mexico, Mesoamerica and South America
               
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Lapointe2">[3]</a>. Larvae and pupae develop in the soil from which adults emerge to search for foliage
               where feeding, aggregation, mating and oviposition take place 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Lapointe3">[4]</a>. Clusters of eggs are laid and secured between mature leaves with an adhesive produced
               by the female thereby protecting them from dessication 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Adair1">[5]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Mannion1">[6]</a>. After hatching, neonate larvae fall to the ground and enter the soil 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Lapointe3">[4]</a>, thus reinitiating the life cycle. Mating occurs primarily during the day whereas
               females lay eggs primarily during the night 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Schroeder1">[7]</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Research on the sensory ecology of 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> is limited. Laboratory and field observations revealed that 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> is attracted to odors emanating from citrus foliage, green beans, conspecifics and
               conspecific feces (i.e., frass) 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Beavers1">[8]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Jones1">[9]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Harari1">[10]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Lapointe4">[11]</a>. In one study, preference by 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> for food odors was influenced by prior feeding 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Harari1">[10]</a>. The presence of a male-produced aggregation pheromone was postulated previously
               
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Schroeder1">[7]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Jones1">[9]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Lapointe4">[11]</a> based on behavioral observations. Specific host plant volatiles involved in the orientation
               behavior of 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> were identified 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-OtloraLuna1">[12]</a> and recently an aggregation pheromone was characterized from the headspace of D.
               
               <i>abbreviatus</i> males feeding on citrus 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Lapointe5">[13]</a>. This unsaturated hydroxy-ester, recently identified as methyl (E)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-2-pentenoate,
               elicited behavioral responses in a two-choice olfactometer. This pheromone, alone
               or in combination with plant volatiles, may play a role in long-range location, as
               it has a low electrophysiological antennal sensory threshold and is produced by clusters
               of males observed in the field on so-called “party trees” 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Lapointe5">[13]</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Less attention has been paid to the response of weevils to visual stimuli. Peak spectral
               sensitivity of the compound eye of 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> was demonstrated at 530 nm (green) and a small number of adults were captured at
               night with traps equipped with a fluorescent green light 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Beavers2">[14]</a>. However, most studies of behavioral responses of arthropods to light have used pigmented
               surfaces which reflect a range of wavelengths. Colors emitted by light emitting diodes
               (LEDs) do not depend on the illuminating conditions and allow for selection and comparison
               of spectra of experimental light sources. Recently, a multiple choice arena adapted
               to a servosphere was developed to observe walking of Colorado potato beetle [
               <i>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</i> (Say)] responding to colored LEDs 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-OtloraLuna2">[16]</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Although the interaction of vision and olfaction in 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> orientation has not been studied, several authors have investigated multimodal stimulation
               in other insects 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Shorey1">[17]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Raguso1">[18]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-mura1">[19]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Balkenius1">[20]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Goyret1">[21]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Patt1">[22]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Kulahci1">[23]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-OtloraLuna3">[24]</a>. Here we investigated the response of male and female 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> to narrow bandwidths of visible light emitted by LEDs offered alone and in combination
               with olfactory stimuli. Our results provide insight into the mechanisms involved in
               the response of a polyphagous weevil, and probably other insects, to multimodal sensory
               inputs and reveal that the response to chemical attractants can be modulated by visual
               stimuli.

               <p>Newly emerged virgin adult 
                  <i>D. abbreviatus</i> were obtained from the U.S. Horticultural Research Laboratory, Fort Pierce, FL, USA
                  
                  <a href="#pone.0053120-Lapointe3">[4]</a>, 
                  <a href="#pone.0053120-Lapointe6">[25]</a>. Adults were identified by sex, and shipped overnight in individual plastic cups
                  with a piece of moist dental wick to the Invasive Insect Biocontrol and Behavior Laboratory,
                  Beltsville, MD, USA where the experiments were performed. Females and males were kept
                  separately in groups of 20 in round plastic containers (height 25 cm, diameter 19
                  cm) in an environmental chamber at 25±1°C and 80±5% relative humidity. Adults were
                  provided young leaves of 
                  <i>Citrus macrophylla</i> Wester until use. Illumination during the photophase (12 L:12 D) was provided by
                  a fluorescent lamp (FG12180-A, General Electric, USA). Weevils tested between the
                  second and fourth week after emergence were starved for approximately 24 hours prior
                  to behavioral experiments. A 2 mm square of adhesive tape was placed on the elytra
                  of weevils used in behavioral assays to prevent flight. Individuals were used only
                  once.

                  <i>D. abbreviatus</i> were tracked while walking on a servosphere (locomotion compensator) (Syntech LC-300,
                  Hilversum, The Netherlands) 
                  <a href="#pone.0053120-Kramer1">[26]</a>, 
                  <a href="#pone.0053120-Hammock1">[27]</a>. This tracking instrument allowed the untethered insect to walk unimpeded in all
                  directions on the apex of a 30 cm diameter white sphere (
                  <a href="#pone-0053120-g001">Fig. 1</a>). A movement detector based on active pixel sensor (APS) technology integrated with
                  a near-infrared 8-LED (light-emitting diode) lamp (wavelength peak at 940 nm) was
                  positioned 22 cm above the insect. The near-infrared lamp was integrated with the
                  sensor and illuminated a field of 7 cm in diameter on the apex of the sphere. The
                  signal from the movement detector was processed and sent to servo-motors that drove
                  the sphere in the opposite direction of the insect’s movement in order to maintain
                  its location at the apex of the sphere. Information on movements of the sphere was
                  supplied to a computer by two pulse-generator encoders positioned orthogonally at
                  the equator of the ball, thus allowing for reconstruction of tracks described by the
                  insect’s movements. The movements were measured at a rate of 0.1/s with an accuracy
                  of 0.1 mm.

                           the insect displacement so it remained on its apex (side view). Air passing through
                           a bottle, that contains citrus or males feeding on citrus, carried odors to the weevil.
                           Two different colored lights were presented in paired combinations with LEDs of the

                  made of acrylic plastic (polymethyl methacrylate) walls (thick 5 mm) (Precision Plastics
                  Inc, Beltsville, MD, USA) fitted over a servosphere but allowing the sphere to rotate
                  freely underneath the corridors (
                  <a href="#pone-0053120-g001">Fig. 1</a>). The two corridors bisected each other forming a cross with a square chamber at
                  the apex of the servosphere which coincided with the field of view of the video sensor.
                  The walking insect always rested within this chamber where it was exposed to the experimental
                  stimuli but was unable to reach any of the four arms due to the motion compensation
                  of the servosphere (open loop set up). The inner lateral walls of the arena corridors
                  were covered with steel metal mirrors to avoid biases caused by shadows produced at
                  the corners of the corridors. The top of each arm was covered with a black roof made
                  of acrylic plastic. The central chamber top was left uncovered in order to track the
                  insect movement with the video sensor and to allow odors to exit the arena (see Chemical
                  stimuli).

               <p>Within the multiple choice arena, different pairs of monochromatic lights produced
                  by light emitting diodes (LEDs, RadioShack, Fort Worth, TX, USA; LED Supply, Randolph,
                  VT, USA) were offered during a two minute test period (
                  <a href="#pone-0053120-g001">Fig. 1</a>). The optical axes of the light beams were directed towards the insect that walked
                  on the apex of the sphere by positioning LEDs at an angle of 9° to the insect at the
                  end of each of the four corridor arms (
                  <a href="#pone-0053120-g001">Fig. 1</a>). LEDs were the only source of visible light in the experimental room, so they were
                  perceived by the insect as spots of light in the dark. Intensity and wavelength of
                  emitted light were measured with a spectrometer (USB4000; Ocean Optics, Dunedin, FL,
                  USA). The intensity of light emitted by each LED was regulated with a stimulator device
                  (Grass S44 and S88; Grass Instruments, Quincy, MA, USA), so each LED emitted a photon
                  intensity or flux 
                  <a href="#pone.0053120-Endler1">[29]</a> of approximately 1.55×10
                  <sup>17</sup> photons m
                  <sup>−2</sup> s
                  <sup>−1</sup>. Green LEDs for low intensity light experiments emitted approximately 1.55×10
                  <sup>10</sup> photons m
                  <sup>−2</sup> s
                  <sup>−1</sup> (dim green). Colors emitted by LEDs had narrow wavelength bands that varied in width
                  from 50 to 90 nm; these spectral bandwidth ranges were calculated from the two wavelengths
                  on either side of the spectrum given at the intensity value that equals ½ of the peak
                  value. The beam radiation pattern corresponded to a narrow-angled specular LED. Maximum
                  peaks and centroid wavelengths did not differ by more than 5 nm, i.e., wavelength
                  shapes were highly symmetric. Peak wavelengths tested occurred at 351 (ultraviolet),
                  472 (blue), 570 (green), 585 (yellow) and 660 nm (red) 
                  <a href="#pone.0053120-OtloraLuna2">[16]</a>. Color names correspond to the subjective visual sensation produced on the human
                  eye by these wavelengths. Corridors not supplied with LEDs were dark.
               </p>
               <p>Opposite arms were equipped with the same color cue at the end of each corridor to
                  provide a symmetrical photic environment. Four stimulation points were used rather
                  than two to produce two uniform fields of vision. Two LEDs would each produce two
                  different stimuli differing in shape and intensity: the point source and the reflected
                  light on the opposing wall. The insect would see the light emitted directly by a particular
                  color LED, and the light reflected on the opposite wall of the arena that appears
                  as a different shape and intensity. By using 4 LEDs (two opposite LEDs for each color
                  in the perpendicular corridors), the insect was presented with two homogeneous sets
                  of stimuli. The arrangement of corridors avoided reflection by the walls of the arena
                  and the blending of the different colors being tested. The use of corridors reduced
                  sources of reflected light, i.e., each corridor (‘x’ and ‘y’) channeled and separated
                  the light reaching the insect from that reflected by the surroundings.

               <p>Headspace odors were provided by 2.4 g of 
                  <i>C. macrophylla</i> leaves or 10 male 
                  <i>D. abbreviatus</i> feeding on similarly prepared 
                  <i>C. macrophylla</i> leaves placed in 500 ml glass gas-wash bottles (
                  <a href="#pone-0053120-g001">Fig. 1</a>). Gas-wash bottles were left to equilibrate for at least 10 min before presenting
                  volatiles in the headspace as the odor stimulus to the weevils. Insects were stimulated
                  during a two-minute test period (see below). The odor delivery system consisted of
                  a charcoal-filtered air-stream maintained at 25°C and 60–73% r.h. as measured by a
                  hygro-thermometer (EA25, Extech Instruments, Waltham, MA, USA; accuracy: ± 3% r.h.
                  and ± 1°C) flowing at 6 l/min (30 ± 15 cm/s airspeed as measured by a hot-wire anemometer,
                  model 441S, Kurtz, CA, USA; accuracy ± 0.01 m/s) that passed through a stainless steel
                  tube (dia. 2 cm, length 4 cm). This tube was painted black, to exclude unexpected
                  influences from asymmetries, and positioned on the horizontal plane tangent to the
                  apex of the sphere, i.e., at an angle of 0° to the insect, and 18 cm from the insect
                  at the end of one corridor of the multiple choice arena. A laminar flow over the insect
                  was made by passing the airflow through a spongy steel insert within the tube. A second
                  charcoal-filtered air-stream (Stimulus Controller CS-55, Syntech, The Netherlands)
                  passing through the gas-wash bottle containing the odor sources was injected at 150
                  ml/min immediately downstream of the spongy steel, so the air from the flasks was
                  diluted 40-fold in the main air stream. Note that this second air flow was set in
                  order to assure that the stimulus was constant (i.e., not depleted) during the 2 minutes
                  period of stimulation. During the chemo-stimulation period 300 ml out of 500 ml were
                  displaced from the odor bottle. Additionally, &gt; 15 minutes elapsed between experiments
                  so insects and plants had time to emit more volatiles and bottles with odors were
                  replaced after testing 10 insects. The control consisted of a clean gas-wash bottle;
                  the headspace of this bottle was injected during the control periods through the second
                  charcoal-filtered air-stream. The onset and cessation of the light stimulus to the
                  insect was synchronized with that of the chemical stimulus by use of a solenoid valve.
                  The experimental setup was positioned near an exhaust hood to remove odors from the
                  laboratory arena.

               <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">Behavioral Experiments</div>
               <p>Two sets of experiments were performed. One set consisted of experiments in which
                  each insect was given a choice between two monochromatic LED pairs in still air (group
                  1). Responses of weevils to colored lights were recorded for 3 min 
                  <a href="#pone.0053120-OtloraLuna2">[16]</a>. The other set of experiments comprised 4 series of bioassays (group 2). In the first
                  series, weevils were stimulated during the test period with air that had passed over
                  the headspace of citrus leaves (series I: citrus alone) and in the second series,
                  weevils were stimulated with air that had passed over male weevils feeding on citrus
                  leaves (series II: citrus + males). In a third experimental series, weevils were stimulated
                  with colored LEDs during the test period; a blue LED was placed above the tube that
                  served as source of clean air that stimulated the insect and another blue LED was
                  placed on the opposite arm of this corridor, while the other two arms were provided
                  with a green LED each (series III: clean air + blue vs. green). Finally, the insect
                  was simultaneously subjected to chemical and photic stimuli (series IV: citrus + males
                  + blue vs. green) during the test period. In this series, each insect was given the
                  choice between a blue LED + volatiles from males feeding on citrus versus another
                  opposite blue LED and two green LEDs; blue and green LEDs were positioned as in series
                  III. In all experiments, LEDs were the only source of illumination in the room. Responses
                  were recorded for three consecutive 2-min periods 
                  <a href="#pone.0053120-OtloraLuna3">[24]</a>: in the air stream alone (control), in the air stream plus other experimental stimuli
                  (test), and in the air stream after removal of the experimental stimuli (end-control).
                  The eolic stimulation (air stream) was supplied during control, test, and end-control
                  periods, but chemical and photic stimuli were only supplied during the test period.
                  Experiments were performed during insect photophase, in a dark room at 25±0.5°C and
                  40±10% RH as measured by a hygro-thermometer (EA25, Extech Instruments, Waltham, MA,
                  USA, accuracy: ± 3% r.h. and ± 1°C). To control for unexpected influences from asymmetries
                  or bias within the apparatus and room, the colors were changed between the corridors
                  after testing half of the insects. Each of the four experimental series was run with
                  both females and males. As 
                  <i>D. abbreviatus</i> can be reluctant to move for several hours after being manipulated, most weevils
                  were induced to walk by touching the tarsus of a metathoracic leg with forceps for
                  less than one second. Insects manipulated in such a manner often walked continuously
                  on the servosphere for hours. After this evasive response, each insect was allowed
                  to adapt to the servosphere by walking during ≥5 min before starting a recording to
                  allow it to acclimate to the experimental conditions, i.e. diminish any stress caused
                  by the experimental procedures. Insects that failed to walk were discarded (approximately
                  10%).

               <p>The x-y coordinates provided by the servosphere at intervals of 0.1 s were merged
                  in step-sizes of 10 units for more efficient summarizing of the tracks 
                  <a href="#pone.0053120-Kitching1">[30]</a>, 
                  <a href="#pone.0053120-OtloraLuna4">[31]</a>. This merger provided step-size intervals of 1 s which allowed the insect to move
                  at least 50% of its length before recording its next position. This merger of intervals
                  took into account that the mean length of 
                  <i>D. abbreviatus</i> reared with F1675 artificial diet was approximately 20 mm 
                  <a href="#pone.0053120-Lapointe6">[25]</a> and its average speed was approximately 20 mm/s. This step-size was large enough
                  to reduce noise produced by insect movements such as wobbling while walking. Instantaneous
                  displacement and direction were computed from the position changes within each interval.
                  Kinematic parameters such as speed (i.e., magnitude of velocity), linearity, path
                  straightness and turning velocity were calculated from instantaneous values using
                  previously developed equations 
                  <a href="#pone.0053120-Batschelet1">[32]</a>, 
                  <a href="#pone.0053120-Bell1">[33]</a>. Linearity was calculated by dividing displacement (distance in a straight line from
                  origin to end point) and walking distance. Path straightness was calculated as the
                  length of the circular mean vector that describes the weevil’s path. Both linearity
                  and path straightness served to measure tortuosity of the path. Walking tracks were
                  reconstructed by plotting the cumulative addition of consecutive positions. To identify
                  stops, 3 mm/s was considered the minimum speed 
                  <i>D. abbreviatus</i> had to achieve to be considered walking; values below this speed were produced by
                  other movements such as grooming the antennae or legs. Speed, turning speed and path
                  straightness indices for each series were calculated as each insect’s average parameter
                  during the test period minus its average parameter during the control period.

               <p>Two methods were used to characterize weevil orientation responses according to the
                  number of choices offered to each individual in order to facilitate presentation of
                  the data. Relative displacement in the ‘x’ and ‘y’ corridors was compared to evaluate
                  response during 3 minute runs when offered the choice of two pairs of colored LED
                  lights. This system allowed for comparison of all experiments where colors were evaluated.
                  To characterize the effects of chemical and photic stimuli on weevil orientation (i.e.,
                  four choices) each arm within the arena was assigned with an arbitrary angle of 45°
                  either side of each stimulus. In the “multimodal experiments” where more than two
                  choices were offered, we considered that a weevil chose a particular corridor (0°,
                  90°, 180° or 270° directions) when it walked into the corresponding area described
                  by the cardinal direction ± 30°. Percentage of displacement within cones defined by
                  these angles was calculated for each 2-min track (control, test and end-control periods).

               <p>In the absence of light, the addition of citrus volatiles to the air stream (series
                  I) during the test period did not elicit an orientation response (
                  <a href="#pone-0053120-g003">Fig. 3A, B</a>). Percentages of walking distance in the 90° angles assigned to each of the four

                  control, test or end-control periods (Kruskal-Wallis test, α = 0.05) (
                  <a href="#pone-0053120-g003">Fig. 3A</a>). The distance walked within each angle as a percent of the total distance did not
                  differ between the test and the previous control period, i.e., indices were not significantly
                  different from zero (Wilcoxon signed rank test,

                  (Kruskal-Wallis test, α = 0.05). However, the addition of volatiles produced by 10
                  males feeding on citrus foliage to the air stream in the absence of light (series
                  II) induced weevils to walk more upwind (0°) towards the odor source compared with
                  either crosswind (90° and 270°) or downwind (180°) during the test period (
                  <a href="#pone-0053120-g003">Fig. 3C, D</a>). Walking distances in the 90° angles were significantly different between the four

                           the first series, weevils were stimulated during the test period with air that had
                           passed over the headspace of citrus leaves (citrus alone) and in the second series,

                           leaves (citrus + males). In a third experimental series, weevils were stimulated with
                           colored LEDs during the test period; a blue LED was placed above the tube that served
                           as source of clean air that stimulated the insect and another blue LED was placed

                           a green LED each (clean air + blue vs. green). Finally, each insect was given the
                           choice between a blue LED + volatiles from males feeding on citrus versus another

            <p>The first group of experiments demonstrated a preference by 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> for green versus blue or ultraviolet light, and no preference expressed when offered
               a choice of green or yellow. As the walls of the corridors were made of reflective
               material, it is possible that the LED lights could have been taken as background illumination
               by the insects. The adaptive value of phytophagous insects' preference for green and
               yellow wavelengths reflected by most plant foliage including citrus leaves 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Turrel1">[38]</a> has been discussed in previous works 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Prokopy1">[39]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-OtloraLuna2">[16]</a>. It is believed that attraction of herbivorous insects to green and yellow wavelengths
               allows them to discriminate foliage (reflectance range of 500 to 580 nm) from non-foliage
               hues (peaking at &lt;500 nm or &gt;580 nm) 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Prokopy1">[39]</a>. On the other hand, green light elicited less attraction than darkness or dimmed
               green light, i.e., individuals preferred to walk toward darkened corridors or those
               where light was lower. The fact that the weevils showed preference for red versus
               green or darkness suggests they may not perceive red or, perceive it as a dim light.
               Most insects are relatively insensitive to red as they do not have specific receptors
               responsive to this part of the spectrum 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Briscoe1">[40]</a>. This negative phototaxis was unexpected because 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> usually exhibits a diurnal rhythm of activity, such that field populations feed and
               mate during photophase while oviposition occurs during scotophase 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Schroeder1">[7]</a>. The negative phototaxis observed here could also be associated with the search for
               refuge by disturbed individuals, suggesting a possible escape response. We cannot
               discard that this behavior could be associated with the fact that insects were induced
               to walk by touching a posterior leg with forceps.
            </p>
            <p>Our first results allowed us to select green as an attractive color and blue as an
               unattractive control cue to be compared with a chemical attractant in the second (multimodal)
               set of experiments. When volatiles emanating from citrus alone or males feeding upon
               citrus were compared, the latter was the most potent attractant likely due to the
               presence of the male-produced aggregation pheromone, methyl (E)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-2-pentenoate
               
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Lapointe5">[13]</a>. Although weevils could be performing an escape response, the response induced by
               the chemosensory cue revealed a clear attraction behavior. In evoking attraction,
               it is probable that the pheromone played a key role by diminishing the repellency
               associated with insect stress and the emission of secondary metabolites (i.e., plant
               defense volatiles) commonly produced by foliage damaged by feeding. The combination
               of host volatiles + pheromones is known as a powerful attractant, likely mimicking
               conditions encountered by the insect 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Landolt1">[41]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Reddy1">[42]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Dickens1">[43]</a>. Under the conditions of our study, green light was preferred over the chemical stimulus
               produced by conspecifics feeding on the host. We tested color preference in a dark
               arena in order to control other stimulus variables, thus assuring that the orientation
               response was evoked by the single light stimulus. The behavior of weevils, and the
               hierarchy observed between colors and scents could be different under other light
               conditions.
            </p>
            <p>The multimodal stimulation study performed with Colorado potato beetle, 
               <i>Leptinotarsa decemlineata,</i> in a similar dual-choice arena revealed subordination of chemotaxis to phototaxis
               
               <a href="#pone.0053120-OtloraLuna3">[24]</a>. Green and yellow were the most attractive lights for 
               <i>L. decemlineata</i> and darkness was unattractive. 
               <i>L. decemlineata</i> was positively phototactic when offered dark and light cues 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-OtloraLuna3">[24]</a>. In contrast, 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> did not show a strong phototactic response. Green light elicited less attraction
               than darkness or dim green light. Responses observed here suggest that hue, not brightness
               of the emitted green light, was mainly responsible for the attraction. For this reason,
               blue was selected as an unattractive cue to be offered versus green in the presence
               of the olfactory stimulus.
            </p>
            <p>Kinematic parameters such as speed, turning speed and path straightness were affected
               by different stimulus treatments. The observed decreased turning speed and increased
               path straightness showed that weevils walked less tortuously in the presence of light
               emitted by LEDs during the test period compared with the control and end-control periods.
               Similarly, CPB turned at a lower rate and walked a straighter path in the presence
               of lights of different wavelengths compared with darkness 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-OtloraLuna2">[16]</a>. The comparatively greater amount of information provided by vision presumably allows
               these insects locomotory control resulting in less tortuous paths in the presence
               of light. Volatiles produced by males feeding on citrus also induced a slight decrease
               of turning speed, highlighting the role of this odor as a guiding stimulus. In the
               absence of stimuli such as lights or an attractive odor, insects probably need to
               perform a faster sequential sampling to facilitate their searching, moving the antennal
               receptors of their bodies from one place to another in order to measure a temporal
               gradient that could allow them to infer the spatial gradient 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Dusenbery1">[15]</a>. This maneuvering in which turns are oriented randomly with respect to the stimulus
               field in the absence of information about its target has been termed 
               <i>klinokinesis</i> or 
               <i>indirect guiding</i>
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Dusenbery1">[15]</a>. Male weevilś increase in speed during photo-stimulation can be explained similarly;
               light provides spatial information that facilitates 
               <i>direct guiding</i> wherein information is obtained about the orientation of the stimulus field resulting
               in reduced sampling. 
               <i>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</i> also achieved higher speeds in the presence of light 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-OtloraLuna3">[24]</a>, a response that can be associated with direct guiding behavior.
            </p>
            <p>It is unclear why female 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> did not walk faster than males given their larger size and longer legs 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Lapointe6">[25]</a> as reported for female CPB 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-OtloraLuna3">[24]</a>. Positive correlation of walking speed with size may only occur below a maximum size
               
               <a href="#pone.0053120-McMahon1">[44]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Bouyssy1">[45]</a>; females and males of this weevil species are larger than 
               <i>L. decemlineata</i>
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Roderick1">[46]</a>, 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Teder1">[47]</a>. Alternatively, the presence of an innate response associated with some unknown fitness
               value could be involved.

            <p>Although several authors have performed similar multimodal studies, they have mostly
               focused on the 
               <i>synergistic</i> effect between color and odor stimuli on choice behavior of phytophagous insects

               <a href="#pone.0053120-Kunze1">[48]</a> and

               <a href="#pone.0053120-Kulahci1">[23]</a>. Here, we demonstrated the disruptive effect of a colored light over odor stimuli,
               and measured kinematic parameters that were not taken into account by previous researchers.
               Orientation behavior similar to what we observed for 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> was shown for 
               <i>Trichoplusia ni</i> (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in a wind tunnel 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Shorey1">[17]</a>. When male moths were simultaneously presented with a low-intensity incandescent
               light and a female-produced sex pheromone, more males congregated at the light than
               at the pheromone source. Primacy of visual over olfactory cues was also reported for
               
               <i>Vanessa indica</i> (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae). Naïve butterflies depended primarily on color and secondarily
               on scent during flower visitation 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-mura1">[19]</a>. In dual-choice experiments, 
               <i>M. sexta</i> moths showed a strong bias for a visual display over an odor plume, suggesting the
               former to be the primary attractant to a nectar source 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Goyret1">[21]</a>. The diurnal moth 
               <i>Macroglossum stellatarum</i> (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) strongly favored a visual stimulus when presented simultaneously
               with an odor 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Balkenius1">[20]</a>. On the other hand, the nocturnal moth 
               <i>Deilephila elpenor</i> (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) responded preferably to odor 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Balkenius1">[20]</a>. Positive phototaxis in the beetle 
               <i>Trypodendron lineatum</i> (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) prior to flight experience was abolished after beetles experienced
               flight coinciding with a switch to chemotactic orientation 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Graham1">[49]</a>. In contrast to flight-naïve 
               <i>T. lineatum</i> that showed no chemotactic behavior regardless of the presence or absence of light,
               
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> showed a hierarchy between chemo- and phototaxis in the fourth series of experiments
               presented herein, where the presence of the green light abolished upwind anemotaxis
               elicited by the combination of plant + male volatiles.
            </p>
            <p>Many phytophagous insects use olfactory cues for long-range orientation to their host
               plants, and visual (and taste) cues at close range. Specific odors from the host plant
               combined with the pheromone probably are used by 
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i> for long-range searching. Although, it is difficult to clarify if the responses observed
               here are long- or short-range, weevil preference of green color over the attractive
               odors suggests a short range response; the insect walking on the servosphere presumably
               senses that it is close enough to the plant because the odor intensity does not change
               while it walks, and uses green color to complete its search for food. This hypothesis
               would predict the results of this and previous studies. The adaptative value for the
               modulation of semiochemical attractiveness by vision, i.e., dominance of positive
               green-phototaxis over blue-phototaxis and chemotaxis as an orientating mechanism in
               
               <i>D. abbreviatus</i>, is not immediately obvious. However, insight into such strong responses to visual
               stimuli by chemically stimulated insects may be provided when the amount of information
               supplied by vision and olfaction is compared. The information transmission capacity
               of complex eyes is estimated to be several orders of magnitude higher than the olfactory
               system 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-Dusenbery1">[15]</a>. A broader discussion of this matter was presented elsewhere 
               <a href="#pone.0053120-OtloraLuna3">[24]</a>.
            </p>
            <p>The results obtained in this study may be useful to develop applications to control
               this pest. These finding may serve in the design of a hypothetical trap for capturing
               weevil adults.
